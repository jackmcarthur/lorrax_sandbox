"""Batched trial-stack BSE matvec — one T-tensor alive regardless of n_trials.

``build_bse_stack_matvec`` returns a jitted

    matvec(X[n_trials, c, v, k], psi_c_X, psi_c_Y, psi_v_X, psi_v_Y,
           eps_c, eps_v, W_R, V_q0, M_X, M_Y)  ->  out[n_trials, c, v, k]

for the TDA BSE (or RPA) Hamiltonian ``H = D + V - W`` (``D + V`` for RPA).

The exchange pair amplitudes ``M_X`` (μ on x) and ``M_Y`` (ν on y) are pure
functions of ψ (``compute_pair_amplitude``), so they are HOISTED to matvec inputs
(precomputed ONCE per solve at load time, ``bse_io``) rather than rebuilt inside
every iteration — the matvec is a per-iteration black-box jit whose ψ args XLA
cannot hoist across calls (audit P3, ``reports/bse_refactor_map_2026-07-15/archive/
matvec_efficiency_audit``). Peak-neutral (both M's already lived inside every call);
only the between-matvec floor rises by ~2·M/p. ``psi_c_Y``/``psi_v_X`` are retained
in the signature for a uniform calling convention with the ring matvecs (they now
feed only the W-term's ``psi_c_X``/``psi_v_Y``; the V-term reads the hoisted M's).

Why a stack matvec.  The four legacy TDA matvecs (ring/gather/simple/serial)
carry the trial axis ``b`` on the direct-term tensor ``T[b, μ, ν, t, s, k]`` —
per device ``n_trials · μ_loc · ν_loc · ns² · nk`` complex128, LINEAR in
``n_trials`` (the memory hog).  Here the W-term is ONE ``shard_map`` whose body
is a ``lax.scan`` over the trial axis, so XLA reuses the body's scratch across
iterations: exactly ONE ``T``-family is alive regardless of ``n_trials``.  A
Python-unrolled or ``fori_loop``-over-trials-inside-``jit`` would pile up
``n_trials`` live ``T`` slots (the known slot-pile-up failure mode,
``feedback_path_d_scaffolding_pattern``); the scan avoids it.  Collectives run
per trial inside the scan body — the memory-for-comm trade the design chose.

Exchange (V) is the B1 dense form (VERDICT.md): DENSE in (k,k'), encode k-SUMMED
into a k-free ζ-space density, decode broadcast at every k.  ``S,U`` are k-free
(tiny, ``n_trials × ν``) so the V term stays outside the scan, batched.

Shardings (``make_bse_shardings``) are unchanged; ``n_trials`` occupies the
leading axis of ``sh.X = P(None,'x','y',None)`` that block ``b`` used to.

The W-tile seam is the single line ``U = fft_k(W_R * ifft_k(T))``: ``W_R`` is a
shape-stable ``(μ_pad, ν_pad, nkx, nky, nkz)`` argument built ONCE outside the
matvec, so W(ω) / ladder buildouts pass a different ``W_R`` with no change to
encode/decode/scan.

Retirement plan (NOTED, not yet executed) — the ring/gather/simple TDA matvecs
existed only to bound ``T``'s peak; this scan bounds it strictly better, so they
are superseded.  Consumers repointed here: ``bse_lanczos.solve_bse_sharded``
(block-Lanczos + Davidson) and ``bse_feast`` (TDA GMRES contour solves +
``_rayleigh_ritz`` subspace application).  Still live pending a follow-up:
  * ``bse_ring_comm.build_bse_ring_matvec`` — used by
    ``bse_feast.estimate_spectral_bounds_sharded`` (spectral-bound Lanczos) and
    the equality gates.  Repoint + delete together with ``bse_simple`` and the
    ``matvec_kind`` data key once the spectral-bound Lanczos is moved over.
  * ``bse_ring_comm.build_bse_ring_matvec_full`` (non-TDA S=[[A,B],[-B†,-A†]]):
    OUT OF SCOPE (B2 malformed B-encode is unfixed).  When B2 lands it should
    reuse this module's ``_w_stack`` encode/decode rather than its own.

# ===========================================================================
# LORRAX_BSE_MATVEC_OPT — the ONE dial for this kernel's two measured levers
# ===========================================================================
#
# Grammar: a comma list of tokens from ``_MATVEC_OPTS``; empty/unset = none.
# An UNKNOWN token REFUSES.  That refusal is the point: this project has
# already shipped a flag (``LORRAX_FFT_FFI_FUSED``) whose consumer accepted
# ``=yes`` and silently ignored ``=Y``, so a run could be labelled "optimised"
# and be running the baseline.  A perf dial that can be misspelled into a
# no-op makes every A/B built on it void.
#
#   [densek REMOVED 2026-07-31 — owner directive, no exceptions.]  It replaced
#           the k-space FFT pair with a dense (nk x nk) DFT contraction.  It
#           was correct and measured 2.30x on the matvec, and that is exactly
#           why it is gone: dense is O(nk^2) against the FFT's O(nk log nk),
#           so it wins only because this deck has nk = 16 and it inverts at
#           the thousand-k-point sizes LORRAX targets.  Do not reintroduce a
#           DFT-as-GEMM path under any name or on any measurement.  If the
#           k-transform is hot, fix the FFT (batching, an FFI handler, fewer
#           dispatches) -- 331 ns per four-point transform is dispatch
#           overhead, not arithmetic.
#
#   yhoist  Lift the two 'y'-axis collectives OUT of the per-trial scan.
#           ``all_gather(X_b,'y')`` and the final ``psum_scatter(...,'y')``
#           are the two SMALL collectives (the operand is (c_loc, v, nk) --
#           2 KB per trial at P=64, vs 426 KB for the 'x' pair), so batching
#           them over the trial axis costs 16 KB per rank in total and
#           removes 2 of the 4 collectives per trial.  The 'x' pair is
#           deliberately NOT hoisted: batching those needs an
#           (n_trials, c, nk, ns, nu_loc) staging buffer -- 3.4 MB per rank,
#           an n_trials-fold replication of a T-adjacent intermediate, which
#           is exactly the memory-for-comm trade the owner has vetoed.  The
#           accounting is per-rank bytes, and it is the whole argument for
#           why one half of this is allowed and the other is not.
#           MEASURED (job 7883166): ALONE it is 1.007x on a full production Q
#           -- inside the 3.42% run-to-run spread the same job measured by
#           running its baseline cell twice, i.e. NOTHING.  Combined with
#           the removed dense-k lever it measured 2.319x, because once the
#           FFT is gone the collectives are a much larger share of what is
#           left.  Report it that way: it is not a lever on its own.
#
#   krep    REPLICATE the Krylov vectors.  This one is NOT in this module --
#           it is honoured by the two eigensolver bridges
#           (``exciton_bands.build_path_solver`` and
#           ``bse_lanczos.solve_bse_sharded``), which are the only places that
#           know both the mesh and the flat (block, n_flat) Krylov layout.  It
#           lives in THIS enum so there is one dial and one grammar, not three.
#           The pair-space dimension n_flat = nc_pad*nv_pad*nk is 1024 on the
#           MoS2 4x4 deck -- four orders below N_mu -- yet the flat Krylov axis
#           carries no sharding constraint, so GSPMD tiles it across all 64
#           devices and every reorthogonalisation dot product becomes an
#           all-reduce.  At max_iter=40 with full reorthogonalisation that is
#           sum_j (j+1) = 820 all-reduces of a 1 KB tile per Q, plus a gather
#           for each QR.  Pinning the Krylov basis to P() makes all of that
#           local and leaves ONE all-gather per matvec.
#           THE COST IS NOT SCALE-FREE and must be stated every time this is
#           recommended: the replicated basis is (max_iter+1)*n_flat*block*16
#           bytes on EVERY rank -- 5.4 MB at n_flat=1024, but 525 MB at
#           n_flat=1e5.  It is right for a small pair space and wrong for a
#           large one, so it is a dial and not a default.
#
# None of the three changes the number of live (nk, mu_loc, nu_loc, ns^2)-class
# intermediates, which stays at the one ``T_b`` family documented below.
