    attribute written); with ``mode="a"`` the file is opened for
    append / overwrite of the named datasets.

    ``n_rmu_logical`` (= ``meta.n_rmu``) clips every μ axis to the
    logical extent on disk (SlabIO ``valid_shape``): in-memory arrays
    carry the P-dependent padded extent ``meta.n_rmu_padded`` whose pad
    rows are exact zeros, and persisting them verbatim would make the

    ROOT_CAUSE.md defect class, one hop downstream).

    ``init_W0=True`` pre-allocates an all-zeros W0_qmunu dataset sized
    from ``V_qmunu``; the ``W0_ready`` attr on that dataset is set to
    False so downstream readers (bse_io) know to treat it as a
