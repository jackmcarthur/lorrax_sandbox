"""Last-resort SlabIO backend: process_allgather + rank-0 h5py.

Tier 3 of the ``slab_io = auto`` capability router
(``gw_config._route_cpu_slab_io`` / ``_route_gpu_slab_io``:
PHDF5_FFI → PHDF5_HOST → H5PY_ALLGATHER) — selected only when neither
parallel-HDF5 writer is available, or forced explicitly via
``slab_io = h5py_allgather`` / the deprecated ``use_ffi_io = false``
override.  (``use_ffi_io = true`` is a deprecated no-op: the phdf5 FFI
is routed by capability, and it has not been CUDA-only since
workstream AE's host port.)  No CUDA or mpi4py dependency; works in
any container with h5py + jax installed.

Pattern: every rank gathers the global array via
``jax.experimental.multihost_utils.process_allgather(A, tiled=True)``,
then rank-0 writes the hyperslab via serial h5py.  Slower than the
parallel writers (``_slab_io_ffi.py`` / ``_slab_io_mpi_host.py``) at
production scale — rank-0 disk bandwidth bottleneck, plus full-array
gather memory — but byte-identical output.

    * Plain numpy: return as-is.
    * Single process (``process_count() == 1``): plain device_get.
    * Multi-process JAX Array, ``A.is_fully_replicated``: every device
      already holds the full array (e.g. a ``SingleDeviceSharding`` lift
      of a numpy on every host).  Skip the gather entirely and return
      ``A.addressable_data(0)``.  This both saves the identity-jit
      reshard cost and avoids the Path-(D) ``(world * N0, *rest)``
      stacking shape that ``process_allgather(tiled=True)`` returns for
      fully-addressable inputs.
    * Multi-process JAX Array, not fully replicated: this is always
