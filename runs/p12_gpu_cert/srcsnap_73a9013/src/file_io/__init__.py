"""I/O module for reading and writing various file formats.

This module contains:
- wfn_loader: Reading BerkeleyGW WFN.h5 wavefunction files
- wfn_writer: Writing BGW-compatible WFN.h5 from LORRAX NSCF
- qe_save_reader: Reading QE .save directories (crystal + charge density)
- epsreader: Reading epsilon/eps0mat.h5 dielectric files
- tagged_arrays: Reading/writing ISDF tagged arrays (restart files)
- qp_wfn: QP rotation matrices and eigenvalue I/O
- centroids: Centroid file loading
- kin_ion: Kinetic + ionic Hamiltonian I/O

# Back-compat alias: every active caller uses ``WFNReader(path)`` as a
# pure-metadata accessor today.  ``WfnLoader`` covers that surface 1:1
# (mf_header attributes mirrored verbatim; ``_filename`` exposed for
# callers that thread it).  This shim lets the existing import sites
# stay; a follow-up commit will sweep them to ``WfnLoader`` directly.
