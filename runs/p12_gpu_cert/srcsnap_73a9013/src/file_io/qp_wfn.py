Two writers live here:

  by tools that want to apply the QP rotation themselves.
* :func:`write_qp_wfn_h5` — full BGW-compatible ``WFN.h5`` with ψ already
  rotated and energies replaced.  This is the canonical "QP WFN" output
  consumed by downstream BSE / restart paths that just want a WFN.h5

    The ``wfn`` argument is a :class:`~file_io.wfn_loader.WfnLoader` and
    is reused as the ``crystal`` source for :class:`WFNWriter` (it
    exposes the same ``nspin``, ``nspinor``, ``nelec``, ``ecutwfc``,
    ``ecutrho``, ``fft_grid``, ``avec``, ``bdot``, … attributes the
    writer reads).

    Notes
    -----
    Symmetry & k-mesh: the rotation is on the irreducible-k WFN —
    output is on the same irreducible-k grid as the input, with the
    ``mtrx`` / ``tnp`` blocks copied through.  Symmetry-equivalent
    full-zone wavefunctions are reconstructed by downstream consumers
    (BSE, etc.) via the same maps as for the input WFN.

    Spinors: handled identically per (k, s) — the rotation is in band
    space and does not mix spinor components.

    Occupations: ``ifmin`` / ``ifmax`` are inherited from the source
    WFN via :class:`WFNWriter` (which sets ``ifmax = nelec`` on every
    k).  Safe whenever the SC iteration preserves the overall
    valence/conduction band ordering — which holds for insulators with
    QP shifts smaller than the gap.  For metals or near-gap-closure
    systems, an SC update can permute occupied vs. empty bands; the
    output ``occ`` array would then be wrong and would need to be
    recomputed from the QP energies + a fresh midgap E_F before
    handing the file to a downstream consumer that trusts ``occ``.
