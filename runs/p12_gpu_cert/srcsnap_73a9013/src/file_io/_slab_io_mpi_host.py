"""MPI-IO SlabIO backend — host-side parallel HDF5 via mpi4py + h5py.

Spiritual equivalent of :mod:`file_io._slab_io_ffi` for the JAX CPU
backend.  Each rank writes its own hyperslab via collective MPI-IO
through h5py(parallel) + mpi4py — no allgather, no rank-0 bottleneck.

Architecture deliberately parallels :class:`_FfiBackend` *except* for
the async writer thread.  We do writes synchronously on the main
thread because:

1. There's no D2H to overlap (the FFI's worker thread exists to
   overlap CUDA memcpy with H5Dwrite; on CPU XLA the "device" memory
   IS host memory, no copy needed).
2. Cray MPICH defaults to ``MPI_THREAD_SINGLE``; doing MPI-IO calls
   from a worker thread then ``H5Fclose`` on the main thread deadlocks
   because MPI's internal state is rank-thread-specific.  Forcing
   ``MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE`` via ``mpi4py.rc.thread_level = "multiple"``
   would let us mirror the FFI's threaded design, but the perf win
   isn't worth the added complexity at this scale.

MPI-collectives coexistence (scorecard AS, 2026-07-27) — synchronous
writes are NOT sufficient once JAX's own CPU collectives ride MPI:

* With ``JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION=mpi`` the jaxlib wheel's
  MPItrampoline runtime drives the SAME ``libmpi`` as this module,
  from XLA's collectives thread — so this module's "main thread only"
  discipline no longer serializes anything.  That concurrency is only
  defined at ``MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE``, and XLA requests FUNNELED:
  measured at P=16 x 8 nodes, ~29% of runs segfault/hang at the
  ζ-write/V_q boundary (two threads concurrently inside
  ``MPID_Progress_wait``; provider-independent — AS.4b).
* The production stack: ``MPITRAMPOLINE_LIB`` must point at the
  MPIwrapper built by ``config/frontera/build_mpiwrapper.sh`` — it
  upgrades every init request to MULTIPLE and never downgrades — plus
  ``LORRAX_MPI_FINALIZE_FIX=skip_atexit`` via the overlay
  ``sitecustomize`` (jax registers an atexit ``collectives.Finalize``
  AND the C++ destructor finalizes → double-finalize rc=1 without it).
  These are harness-level machine facts, not LORRAX policy: LORRAX
  reads neither variable (see docs/dev/env_vars.md and
  docs/dev/mpi_collectives.md).
* The C++ FFI twin guards the same hazard at open time
  (``ffi/cpp/phdf5/context.cc`` MPI_Query_thread warning), which is what
  fires if the wrapper is missing from the path.

What we DO match from :class:`_FfiBackend`:

* Same ``mode='w'`` inode replace before any rank opens the file (the
  shared ``_replace_inode_for_write``; the layout that actually sticks
  comes from the MPI-IO striping hints — see :func:`_mpi_io_hints`).
* Same collective-write default (``LORRAX_PHDF5_COLLECTIVE_WRITES``,
  on) with replica dedup (``LORRAX_PHDF5_DEDUP_REPLICAS``, on) — see
  ``__init__`` for the wk_AI measurements.
* Same per-rank hyperslab arithmetic derived from JAX's
  ``Array.addressable_shards[i].index`` (a tuple of ``slice`` per dim
  giving the global slab of each local shard).
* Same ``valid_shape`` clipping for arrays padded for even sharding.
* Same deferred ``write_attr`` mechanism for tiny replicated metadata.

The only thing this backend doesn't do that :class:`_FfiBackend` does
is the cudaMemcpy D2H — on JAX's CPU backend the "device" memory IS
host memory, so the local shard is already in numpy-addressable RAM
and we hand the pointer straight to h5py.

Selected by :class:`gw.gw_config.SlabIOBackend.PHDF5_HOST`.  This is now
the SECOND CPU tier, not the first: since workstream AE the phdf5 write
core also compiles into the CUDA-free host FFI lib, and
``gw_config._route_cpu_slab_io`` prefers ``PHDF5_FFI`` whenever that lib
exports ``PhdfWriteHostFfi`` — because the FFI path needs no extra Python
environment, whereas this module needs ``mpi4py`` + an ``HDF5_MPI=ON``
h5py (the ``lorrax_env_mpi_overlay`` prefix, workstream AB).  Kept as the
fallback for a deployed host lib without the write handler, and as the
A/B control for the writer.
