# FFT peak-memory query (for memory-model sizing)
# =============================================================================
# ``gflat_memory_model._fft_box_bytes`` needs the per-rank peak HBM a batched
# 3-D FFT will actually take.  Nominal ``N_copies × data_size`` fudge factors
# under-predict badly for mixed-radix boxes (24 = 2³·3, 10 = 2·5) at small
# batch sizes — cuFFT picks different algorithms there, with non-linear
# workspace growth.
#
# The measurement has TWO halves and needs both.  ``compiled.memory_analysis()``
# gives XLA's buffer-assignment peak; the cuFFT *plan workspace* is not in
# buffer assignment at all (jaxlib's FftThunk takes it from a runtime scratch
# allocator), so memory_analysis alone is a systematic low bound.  This
# function compiles the FFT and hands the executable to
# ``runtime.aot_memory.aot_kernel_peak_bytes``, which adds the cuFFT term by
# querying ``cufftMakePlanMany`` on jaxlib's own libcufft.  That module owns
# the cuFFT half; this function owns "which FFT, at which shape/sharding".
#
# Called statically at chooser time (never in a hot loop), so the ~1-2 s
# per-shape compile is amortised over the run and cached per unique shape.

# FFI backend for the flat-k helpers — REQUIRED (decisions.md 2026-08-01)
# ============================================================================
# The service itself lives in ``src/ffi/fft.py`` (Python) + ``src/ffi/cpp/
# mklfft`` and ``src/ffi/cpp/cufft`` (handlers).  THIS file used to carry a
# second, drifting copy of the gate and both bodies (delegated 2026-07-30),
# and then a gated XLA twin of the flat-k transform (DELETED 2026-08-01
# under the FFI-required ruling: where a certified FFI path exists, the
# native-JAX duplicate is not maintained).
#
# What the service is: the flat-k batched 3-D FFTs dispatched to the platform
# FFI library — MKL FFT via the DFTI descriptor API on cpu meshes, cuFFT with
# the advanced data layout (cufftPlanMany64) on CUDA meshes.  Both libraries
# register the SAME target names, so the call sites are platform-agnostic.
# WHY: XLA's fft custom-call wants the transformed axes minor-most, so every
# dot(k-major) <-> fft(k-minor) boundary in the Σ τ kernel pays a full
# transpose of the ~398 MB/rank μ² tile (60-65% of sigma.exec at nb=128/P=64).
# Stride descriptors read the dot-layout tile where it lies, so the transposes
# disappear instead of moving.  Contract: ``docs/dev/flat_k_fft_service.md``.
#
# What stays here: the OWNER RULE that these helpers are the single FFT entry
# point (``make_flat_k_fft`` below is still the only door), and the XLA
# ``make_sharded_*fftn_3d`` / ``local_*fftn3`` layer above — those serve the
# shard_map-INTERIOR call sites (isdf/core, wfn_transforms, BSE) that have
# no FFI route, which the ruling explicitly keeps.
