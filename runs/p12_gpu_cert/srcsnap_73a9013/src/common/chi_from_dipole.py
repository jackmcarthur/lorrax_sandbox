# ============================================================================
# WARNING: this S(ω) is in the DFT basis only — must be re-derived for SC GW
# ============================================================================
#
# The three inputs ``dipole_cart``, ``deltaE``, ``f_nk`` are all evaluated
# from a single *fixed* basis: the DFT eigenstates that wrote ``dipole.h5``.
# Concretely:
#
#   dipole_cart[α, k, m, n] = ⟨ψ^DFT_m,k | v_α | ψ^DFT_n,k⟩      (3, nk, nb, nb)
#   deltaE[k, m, n]         = E^DFT_n,k − E^DFT_m,k               (nk, nb, nb)
#   f_nk[k, n]              = occupation at DFT eigenvalue        (nk, nb)
#
# For a one-shot G0W0 / single-cycle QSGW, this is fine — the bra/ket states
# v_α is sandwiched between are the DFT eigenstates the rest of the pipeline
# also uses.  But every quantity here is wrong as soon as the pipeline
# rotates ψ to the QP basis (i.e. SC GW with U ≠ 1):
#
#   1. Basis-change of the velocity matrix
#      With U[k, m, n] = ⟨DFT_m,k | QP_n,k⟩ from eigh(H_qp_dft):
#
#          V_α^QP(k)_{mn} = Σ_{pq} U^*(k)_{pm} V_α^DFT(k)_{pq} U(k)_{qn}
#                         = (U(k)^† V_α^DFT(k) U(k))_{mn}
#
#      einsum: 'kpm,akpq,kqn->akmn' with (np.conj(U), v_dft, U).  This is
#      the OPPOSITE direction of ``sc_iteration._rotate_to_dft_basis``,
#      which does U·O·U^† to bring Σ from QP back to DFT.  The dipole is
#      naturally a DFT-basis operator that we want to express in QP basis,
#      hence the dagger is on the left.
#
#   2. Energy denominators
#      ΔE in the dipole formula appears in the denominator
#      ΔE · (ω² − ΔE²); if ΔE keeps DFT values while V is QP-rotated, the
#      head spectrum mis-aligns with the actual QP transitions by the QP
#      shifts.  After SC convergence, ΔE_QP[k, m, n] = E_QP[k, n] − E_QP[k, m]
#      should be used.
#
#   3. Occupations
#      For an insulator that stays insulating across SC, f_nk does not
#      change (still 1 for n < nelec, 0 otherwise — by sorted band index).
#      For metals or near-gap-closure systems where SC can swap valence
#      and conduction near E_F, f_nk must be rebuilt from E_QP vs. the
#      converged E_F^QP.
#
#   4. Self-energy contribution to the velocity operator (TODO, separate)
#      v = p/m + (i/ℏ)[r, V_KS].  At the GW level the KS potential is
#      replaced by V_H + Σ(ω), so the velocity operator itself acquires a
#      Σ-derivative piece that dipole.h5 does NOT capture.  The full
#      "GW-level dipole" is therefore not just U^† v^DFT U — it has an
#      additional ⟨m|∂Σ/∂k|n⟩-like term that needs a separate evaluation
#      in the QP basis.  Rotating the existing DFT dipoles is the
#      necessary first step but isn't sufficient for full QSGW
#      consistency.
#
# Consequences for the SC head correction in compute_ppm_sigma_pipeline:
#
#   - HeadResolver.at(ω) caches S(ω) computed at iteration 1's basis
#     (which is DFT for the iteration-0 init we use today).  The SC loop
#     reuses these cached samples for all subsequent iterations, so the
#     analytic head_gn is fitted to DFT-basis transitions and never
#     refreshed.  For an insulator with QP shifts ≪ gap this is a small
#     error (~ few percent on each head value, propagating to ~10s of
#     meV per band); for systems near gap closure it is wrong.
#
#   - The proper SC fix is to (a) refresh dipole_cart per-iteration via
#     the rotation above, (b) recompute deltaE from the iter's E_QP, (c)
#     refresh f_nk from E_QP vs. E_F^QP, (d) invalidate HeadResolver's
#     cache and reseed at the requested ω's.  Cleanest factoring is to
#     hold the FULL "GW-level dipole" (point 4 above) on SCInputs and
#     update it in lockstep with the H_qp_dft carry.  Until this is done,
#     SC GW results carry an O(QP-shift / gap) systematic on the head.
#
# This file is intentionally NOT modified to do any of (1)-(4); the
# above is a roadmap for whoever does the full GW-level dipole update
# (it has to also include the Σ-derivative piece, which is a separate
# computation outside this module).
