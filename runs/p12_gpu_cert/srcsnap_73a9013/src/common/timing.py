# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# STAGE CADENCE (scorecard AI; the observability gap AC.2 / AC.3c / AF.4c
# each hit independently).
#
# ``timing.section`` accumulates into a tree that is printed ONCE, at the
# end of the run.  Every stage in this codebase is therefore silent while
# it runs, and three separate 30 min-to-3 h stages (the ``pzheevd`` eigh,
# the restart-tensor write, the screening solve) have now been
# indistinguishable from a hang while alive — a job that prints nothing
# cannot be triaged, only waited out or killed.
#
# ``LORRAX_TIMING_TRACE=1`` makes every section announce its entry and
# exit with a wall-clock timestamp on rank 0.  That is a milestone
# cadence for the WHOLE code, including stages that are one monolithic
# jit call and so cannot carry a ``LoopProgress``.  Print-only; the
# accumulated tree and the final report are byte-identical either way.
# ``LORRAX_TIMING_TRACE_DEPTH`` caps nesting depth (default 3).
#
# Sections that must ALWAYS announce (env-independent stage cadence —
# e.g. the screening phases, whose silence was paid for three times:
# AC.2's 30-minute silent pzheevd, AF.4c's 2 h 55 m silent restart
# write, the 2.5 h silent c2406 screening stage) pass
# ``announce=True`` (optionally with a human ``label``) to
# ``timing.section``.  Same formatting path, same rank-0 gate, no
# depth cap — ONE cadence mechanism, not two.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Both knobs are read at USE time, not import time: common.timing is
# imported by essentially every LORRAX CLI, and an import-time ``int()``
# of a malformed LORRAX_TIMING_TRACE_DEPTH killed every rank before
# main() even ran, even with tracing disabled — an observability knob
# must never take down the run it observes (QUALITY_PATTERNS #8; audit
# 2026-07-28).  Use-time reads also match the rest of LORRAX's env
# flags (cf. ``_slab_io_mpi_host._env_flag``): tests/drivers that set
# the env after import see the new value.
