"""The rank-truncation criterion for every pseudo-inverse in LORRAX.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR
-----------------------
Several places in LORRAX truncate a spectrum before inverting it:

* ``bandstructure/htransform.py`` — SVD of ψ-at-centroids, then ``1/σ``
  (``inv_s``) in the Galerkin projector.
* ``isdf/core.py::_rank_trunc_factor`` — eigh of the charge ``C_q``, then
  ``λ^{-1/2}`` (``zeta_rcond``, production default ``1e-8``).
* ``common/zeta_projection.py::least_squares_transfer`` — eigh of the
  small-basis Gram ``G_S``, then ``λ^{-1}``.

All three spectra are ISDF / Galerkin **overlap** spectra.  They are smooth
by construction and **there is no gap, knee, elbow or plateau in them to
find**.  Any criterion phrased as "cut at the separation" is inapplicable
here.  This module states the criterion that is applicable, implements it,
and carries the measurements that chose it.

THE CRITERION
-------------
    Retain the largest subspace on which the pseudo-inverse amplifies by no
    more than a stated factor κ_cap.

For a spectrum ``σ`` of the operator that is actually inverted,

    keep = { i : σ_i > σ_max / κ_cap }        rtol := 1 / κ_cap

and the achieved amplification is ``κ_eff = σ_max / min(σ_kept) ≤ κ_cap``
by construction.  This is exactly the relative threshold the code already
used — the point of this module is that the relative threshold is **not a
gap-finder**; it is a hard cap on noise amplification, it is well defined on
a perfectly smooth spectrum, and ``rtol`` is the reciprocal of a number with
a physical meaning (how much round-off the inverse is allowed to multiply).

WHY THE FAILURE MODE FIXES THE OBJECTIVE
----------------------------------------
The danger is **not** cutting a real direction.  It is **keeping a near-null
one**, whose pseudo-inverse amplifies noise by ``1/σ``.  Measured on this
code (docs/dev/notes/ladder_rung1_R19_zeta_rcond.md, MoS2 4×4, nb=1024, μ≈10k,
``zeta_rcond`` swept, everything else fixed):

    zeta_rcond   retained rank   eqp0        eqp1
    1e-8              6700       3.1350      3.0710
    1e-10             8290    -206.83    -1039.84
    1e-12             9461   -5049.59     -304.20

Retaining **41 % more rank** moved the answer from wrong-by-2.8-eV to wrong
by 5000 eV on a 2.2 eV DFT gap.  So the criterion must control the
**conditioning of the downstream solve**, not the **fidelity of the
decomposition**.  Every criterion in the standard regularisation toolbox
targets fidelity, and each is therefore refuted by that table:

* **Discrepancy principle** — truncate at the data's noise floor,
  ``δ ≈ ε_mach · σ_max · √n``.  At LORRAX's sizes (n ~ 1e4) that is
  ``δ/σ_max ≈ 2.2e-14``, i.e. it prescribes ``rtol ≈ 1e-14`` — **looser than
  the 1e-12 that measured −5049.59 eV**, and the degradation is monotone in
  that direction.  Refuted by measurement, not by argument.  This is the
  same "real content six decades above the f64 noise floor" reasoning that
  §R19.1 puts on the record as refuted from both ends.
  :func:`noise_floor_rtol` computes it so the report can show where it sits;
  it is a **reference line, never the cut**.
* **Residual / L-curve on the decomposition** — the truncated-SVD residual
  is ``σ_{k+1}``: monotone non-increasing in k, and on a smooth spectrum it
  has no corner.  The L-curve's corner is where ``‖A⁺b‖`` starts to blow up,
  which is a conditioning statement wearing a residual's clothes, and for a
  smooth power-law spectrum its location is set by the noise level — i.e. it
  degenerates to the discrepancy principle and inherits its refutation.
* **Tikhonov + GCV** — GCV minimises predicted error **of the fit**, so it
  again buys fidelity.  Two in-repo measurements say a fidelity-sized ridge
  is already too big: ``factor_c_q``'s 1e-14·trace ridge "biases htransform's
  small-trace G by ~1e-5" (``htransform.py`` §4 note), and ``zeta_ridge``
  "PERTURBS the physical result … hence opt-in, a physics call"
  (``gw_config.py`` note on ``zeta_ridge``).  The ridge that empirically
  *works* on MoS2 6×6 is ε≈1e-4 — a **conditioning**-sized ridge (κ ~ 1e4),
  not a GCV-sized one.
* **Observable convergence** — sweep the criterion parameter and take the
  plateau **in the energy**.  This is the only one whose verdict matches the
  measurements, and it is the one already executed: the ``zeta_rcond``
  default is documented in ``gw_config.py`` as "the LOW end of the
  over-complete recovery plateau", from MoS2 4×4/1204c (1e-10 → MAE 1.4 eV;
  the whole 1e-8…1e-4 plateau → ~0.04 eV) and bulk Si 4×4×4/960c (1e-6 →
  1.021 meV sigTOT drift; 1e-8 → 0.054 meV).  Note what kind of plateau that
  is: **a plateau of the observable as a function of rtol**, not a plateau
  in the spectrum.  It needs no spectral structure and is therefore legal
  under the owner's ruling.

CONCLUSION, and it is the reason this module changes no default: the
relative threshold is already the right criterion and its value is already
fixed by the only admissible evidence class.  What was missing is that the
invariant it enforces was implicit, unverified per run, and silently broken
by a device-grid round-down.  This module makes the invariant explicit
(:func:`select_rank`), verifies it (:func:`RankReport.violations`), and
reports the margin to the R19 cliff on every run
(:attr:`RankReport.overcomplete_margin`).

THE MARGIN, AND HOW TO READ IT
------------------------------
``overcomplete_margin`` = (rank at ``rtol·1e-4``)/(rank at ``rtol``) − 1: the
fractional rank inflation from loosening the cap by four decades.  It needs
no gap — it is a finite difference of a monotone counting function — and it
has a measured anchor: R19's 1e-8 → 1e-12 loosening inflated the rank by
**+41 %** and destroyed the answer.  A margin near zero means the spectrum
genuinely terminates and the cut is nearly free; a margin of tens of percent
means the basis is over-complete, the cut is load-bearing, and ``rtol`` must
NOT be loosened on that run.

UNITS — do not "harmonise" the two thresholds
---------------------------------------------
``htransform`` thresholds **singular values of A** and inverts ``1/σ``;
``isdf/core`` thresholds **eigenvalues of the Gram C** and inverts ``1/λ``.
Both therefore cap the amplification **of the operator each one actually
inverts** at ``1/rtol``.  The two 1e-8's agree as amplification caps even
though λ ~ σ².  Converting one to the other's units would break both.
