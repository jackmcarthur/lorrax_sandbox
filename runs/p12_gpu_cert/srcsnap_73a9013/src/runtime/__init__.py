"""THE LORRAX runtime: one startup call, one order, one honest report.

Every core driver needs the identical thing done in the identical order
before any physics runs::

    from runtime import initialize_communicator_stack
    RUNTIME = initialize_communicator_stack()   # BEFORE ``import jax``
    import jax
    ...
    mesh_xy = RUNTIME.mesh

The adopters (2026-08-01) are the seven chain drivers — ``gw.gw_jax``,
``centroid.kmeans_cli``, ``psp.get_dipole_mtxels``, ``gw.kin_ion_io``,
``bandstructure.htransform``, ``bse.bse_jax`` and ``bse.exciton_bands`` —
each making exactly ONE module-top call, gated per driver by
``tests/test_crossfile_requests.py`` (the R1 audit).  The two BSE CLIs that
take ``--px/--py`` still start on the canonical square mesh; a different
(square) shape goes through :meth:`RuntimeStack.reshape` (or the BSE factory
``bse.bse_ring_comm.create_mesh_xy``, which reuses the startup mesh whenever
the requested shape matches it).  Only square meshes are supported (repo
``docs/architecture/decisions.md`` 2026-08-01); both paths refuse
``px != py``.

:func:`initialize_communicator_stack` is that call.  It resolves the JAX
environment, installs the fail-fast excepthook, states the CPU-collectives
transport, skips the CUDA plugin on a CPU-only run, initialises
``jax.distributed``, resolves GPU-or-CPU, builds the run's device mesh with
every MPI/NCCL communicator it needs already created, arms the persistent
compile cache, and prints a rank-0 block stating every choice it made where
more than one was possible.  The order is load-bearing and is documented,
step by step with the reason for each step, on the function itself.

WHY IT IS ONE FUNCTION.  These pieces existed before; they were called by
five drivers in four different orders, and the order decides the answer.
The first ``jax.devices()`` freezes the platform and the allocator, so an
``os.environ.setdefault`` after it sets a string and changes nothing —
measured, job 7882443: two runs with byte-identical ``os.environ`` and
``bytes_limit`` 11.805 GB vs 0.000 GB.  ``os.environ`` is a false witness
for allocator state, which is why the report reads the live client.

THE PIECES ARE STILL PUBLIC, and :func:`bootstrap` still bundles the
env/distributed/CPU-fallback half exactly as it did — that is what
:func:`initialize_communicator_stack` calls, so there is one implementation
of the order rather than two.  A driver that genuinely cannot take a mesh
at import time can still call :func:`bootstrap`; it then owns the mesh, the
warm-up and the report itself, and it will drift, which is the situation
this module exists to end.

This module imports jax only inside function bodies, so importing it costs
nothing and the env defaults it sets are in place before jax reads them.
The distributed guard (``_LORRAX_JAX_DISTRIBUTED_DONE``) is an env sentinel
so it survives the re-import path ``python -m gw.gw_jax`` → ``gw_init`` →
``gw.gw_jax``; the mesh guard (``_STACK``) is a module global because a
second mesh is a per-process hazard, not a per-job one.

    The exit-code problem this solves
    ---------------------------------
    In a ``jax.distributed`` run the ranks are peers in a collective
    program.  When one rank raises, CPython unwinds it normally: module
    ``atexit`` handlers run, the collectives backend tries to tear down, and
    the interpreter may block indefinitely inside a communicator whose
    peers are still sitting in a collective the dead rank will now never
    join.  Meanwhile the surviving ranks are blocked in that collective.
    The step ends when srun's timeout or the scheduler reaps it — and the
    campaign's logs repeatedly show that ending as **rc=0 at the sbatch
    level**, with a partial or absent set of outputs and no error anywhere
    near the top of the log.

    The fix is to make the *first* rank to fail exit non-zero,
    immediately, without unwinding:

    * print a rank-tagged banner (so ``tail`` on any log finds it),
    * flush stdout/stderr explicitly (``os._exit`` does not),
    * ``os._exit(1)`` — skipping atexit handlers and backend teardown,
      which is exactly what would otherwise hang.

    srun then sees a non-zero task exit, kills the remaining tasks in the
    step, and the job's exit code is non-zero.  A failure that used to
    look like success now looks like a failure.

    No-op in single-process runs (normal traceback + rc 1 already works,
    and ``os._exit`` would suppress useful teardown).  Opt out with

    Must be called BEFORE the first JAX **backend init** — not merely
    before ``import jax``.  jaxlib reads the GPU knobs in
    ``jaxlib/xla_client.py:generate_pjrt_gpu_plugin_options()``, called
    from ``jax_plugins/xla_cuda12/__init__.py:initialize()`` when the CUDA
    client is created; in this package that is the ``jax.devices()`` inside
    :func:`fallback_to_cpu_if_no_gpu_backend`.  A ``setdefault`` after that
    point sets the string and changes nothing (see the WHY note below).
    Uses ``setdefault`` so any caller-provided override wins.

    ``platform="gpu"`` (default) sets ``JAX_PLATFORMS="cuda,cpu"`` so
    JAX tries CUDA and falls back to CPU.  ``platform="cpu"`` forces CPU.

    WHY ``XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false`` IS SET HERE
    -------------------------------------------------------
    LORRAX's FFI handlers allocate OUTSIDE the XLA allocator — the cuFFT
    handler keeps a grow-only ``cudaMalloc`` arena
    (``ffi/cufft/__init__.py:30``), and cuSOLVERMp/libcal stage through
    plain ``cudaMalloc`` too.  Whatever XLA hoards is memory those cannot
    have, so the preallocation default is a correctness knob for this
    codebase, not a tuning one.

    Left unset, jaxlib omits the ``preallocate`` option entirely and the
    PJRT GPU client defaults to preallocating 75 % of the card.  Measured
    on 8 Quadro RTX 5000 (15.74 GB) across 2 nodes, jobs 7882442/7882447,
    each cell run twice with the second rep in reverse order (every rep-2
    number reproduced its rep-1 twin to 3 decimals):

    ================= ============== ================== =================
    PREALLOCATE       XLA holds      free for the FFI   largest cuFFT
    (allocator unset) for 6 GiB live  arena             plan creatable
    ================= ============== ================== =================
    unset (today)     11.93 GB       3.50 GB            3.07 GB
    ``false``          8.13 GB       13.50 GB           7.16 GB
    ================= ============== ================== =================

    That is a 2.3x improvement in the largest allocatable cuFFT plan, and
    it is the mechanism behind the failure recorded at
    ``scripts/profiling/aot_cufft_sanity.py:24`` (CrI3 Q=13: cuFFT plan
    creation failed although the compiled peak, 66.32 GB, fit in 80 GB).

    ``XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_ALLOCATOR`` is deliberately NOT set, and the four
    accepted values are not interchangeable:

    * ``default``/``bfc`` — BFC.  What we get by leaving this unset.
      Keeps ``memory_stats()`` fully populated, which ``gw_init``'s
      high-water report, ``gw_output``'s XLA-pool banner and
      ``runtime/aot_memory`` all read.
    * ``platform`` — plain ``cudaMalloc``, **not** cudaMallocAsync
      (the plugin logs "Using platform allocator." vs "Using BFC
      allocator." and carries a separate ``CudaAsyncAllocator``).  Best
      headroom, but ``memory_stats()`` returns ``bytes_limit=0`` and
      ``peak_bytes_in_use=0`` — it would silently blind every memory
      report in the codebase.  Measured, job 7882447.
    * ``cuda_async`` — cudaMallocAsync.  Measurably the best of the three
      (0.19 GB overhead, 9.20 GB largest plan) AND it keeps
      ``peak_bytes_in_use``.  It is NOT the default here only because on
      Frontera rtx (sm_75) it needs the command-buffer restriction in
      ``config/frontera/ffi_env.sh:44-51``; that script sets both together
      and its explicit ``export`` correctly overrides this ``setdefault``.
      Promote it here only together with that XLA_FLAGS mitigation.

    ``TF_GPU_ALLOCATOR`` is a TensorFlow variable and is **inert for JAX**:
    a cell setting only ``TF_GPU_ALLOCATOR=cuda_malloc_async`` was
    byte-identical to the unset cell on every metric, including an 11.805
    GB BFC pool that the real ``cuda_async`` allocator never has (job
    7882442).  Do not add it back.

    ValueError never reaches the user.  What reaches the user is::

        RuntimeError: Backend 'cuda' is not in the list of known backends

    which names neither the variable nor the value, and reads as *missing

    fraction of the speed, because of a misspelling in a harness.

    * jaxlib lowercases but does NOT strip, so ``" bfc"`` is a value jaxlib
      REJECTS.  This check must reject it too — accepting it here would

        same node class, discovery stubbed .......  11.3 s
        of which ``jax.devices()`` alone ..........  63.9 s  ->  0.06 s

    ``JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`` does NOT prevent this on its own.
    ``xla_bridge.backends()`` calls ``_discover_and_register_pjrt_plugins()``
    BEFORE it looks at ``jax_platforms`` (jax 0.9.1,
    ``jax/_src/xla_bridge.py:797`` vs ``:808``), discovery imports
    ``jax_plugins.xla_cuda12``, and the FIRST statement of that module's
    ``initialize()`` is ``_load_nvidia_libraries()`` -- a ``ctypes`` dlopen of
    libcudart, libnvrtc, libcublas, libcublasLt, libnccl, libcupti,
    libcusparse, libcusolver, libcufft, libnvshmem_host and libcudnn.  On a
    CPU node every one of those is a cold dlopen of a library that will never
    be used, and it ends in ``cuInit`` failing anyway -- the
    ``RuntimeError: ... operation cuInit(0) failed`` banner every LORRAX CPU
    log carries is the receipt.

    WHY IT IS SLOW, since the byte count looks small.  ``mincore(2)`` over the
    venv right after a cold start (same job) shows only 173 MB resident, 119 MB
    of it CUDA -- at Lustre's 70 MB/s streaming rate that would be ~2 s.  It is
    not a bandwidth cost: dlopen relocation faults scattered 4 KB pages, each
    one a separate Lustre RPC, and it is the RPC latency times tens of
    thousands of faults that produces the minute.  Removing the libraries from
    the critical path removes the faults.

    HOW.  A ``sys.meta_path`` finder answers imports under the ``jax_plugins``
    namespace with a stub module whose ``initialize()`` does nothing.  jax's
    discovery loop then finds a plugin, calls its ``initialize()``, and gets a
    no-op; nothing is dlopened and nothing is registered.  No jax file is
    modified and no package is removed -- the same installed venv still runs
    GPU jobs, because this arms ONLY when the caller has said CPU and nothing
    but CPU.

    THE GATE has two arms, and each one is a case where jax was *already*
    going to end up on CPU -- the skip only lets it find that out before
    paying, never after:

    1. ``JAX_PLATFORMS`` resolves to exactly ``cpu``.  A GPU backend is
       forbidden outright, so the plugin can only be dead weight.

    2. ``JAX_PLATFORMS`` asks for a GPU but this node has no visible NVIDIA
       device (:func:`_gpu_is_present`).  jax's own ``backends()`` does

       pins ``JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu`` and re-states the CPU collectives
       implementation -- so nothing downstream can tell the difference except
       the clock.  A run on a real GPU node NEVER reaches arm 2: the device
       nodes exist, and the CUDA driver cannot work without them.

def tune_glibc_malloc() -> bool:
    """Pin glibc's mmap/trim thresholds so freed XLA:CPU transients go back
    to the OS.  Returns True when the tuning was applied; every path that
    leaves it unapplied (opt-out, missing libc/mallopt, mallopt rejecting
    the value) announces itself on rank 0 — this tuning is a load-bearing
    OOM mitigation, and a guard that matters must say when it is not in
    force (QUALITY_PATTERNS #5/#7).

    WHY (workstream T, measured on Frontera).  XLA:CPU allocates and frees
    every intermediate through plain ``malloc``/``free``.  glibc's mmap
    threshold is DYNAMIC: the first time an mmap'd block is freed, glibc
    raises the threshold to that block's size (capped at 32 MB) and sets
    ``trim_threshold = 2 x mmap_threshold``.  From then on every allocation
    below 32 MB is served from the sbrk heap / per-thread arenas, and heap
    memory is returned to the OS only when the *top* of the heap happens to
    be free.  With 28 XLA worker threads churning multi-MB contraction
    scratch that condition is essentially never met, so RSS ratchets up
    monotonically for as long as the process keeps doing work — anonymous
    memory, page cache flat.

    In the ISDF zeta fit that showed up as a per-r-chunk ramp proportional to
    the back-solve FLOP count: +0.35 GB/rank/r-chunk at MoS2 12x12 / 606
    centroids / P=80, and +6.6 GB/rank/r-chunk at 1998 centroids / P=144,
    which is what killed jobs 7874803 / 7875070 / 7875071 with
    ``std::bad_alloc`` mid-loop while the planner's static estimate was
    comfortable.  ``jax.live_arrays()`` stayed EXACTLY constant throughout —
    nothing was retained on the JAX side.

    Pinning ``M_MMAP_THRESHOLD`` also DISABLES the dynamic adjustment, so
    every allocation at or above the threshold is mmap'd and ``munmap``'d on
    free — returned to the OS immediately, no fragmentation.  Measured cost:
    within noise (~4% on the r-chunk wall at 40 nodes), and steady-state RSS
    dropped 2.3 -> 1.7 GB/rank as a bonus.

    Knobs: ``LORRAX_MALLOC_TUNE=0`` disables; ``LORRAX_MALLOC_MMAP_MB`` /

    Call this ONCE, at the TOP of a driver module, **above the driver's own
    ``import jax``** -- exactly where ``bootstrap()`` used to sit.  It is
    importable without jax (this module imports jax only inside function
    bodies), so the env defaults it sets are in place before jax reads them.

    THE ORDER, AND WHY EACH STEP IS WHERE IT IS
    -------------------------------------------
    0. :func:`install_failfast_excepthook` -- FIRST, earlier than
       ``bootstrap()`` puts it.  Everything below can raise on one rank
       while its peers block in a collective (``jax.distributed.initialize``
       and the clique warm-up are both collective).  The hook is what turns
       that from "the job ends rc=0 with no output" into a non-zero exit,
       so installing it after the collectives would leave the riskiest part
       of startup unprotected.  Idempotent, so ``bootstrap()``'s own call
       below is a no-op.
    1. :func:`set_default_env` -- JAX_ENABLE_X64, JAX_PLATFORMS,
       XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false, the allocator-spelling refusal,
       the glibc malloc tuning, and the first arming of the CPU-only plugin
       skip.  MUST precede the first backend init; jax reads x64 at import
       and the GPU knobs when the CUDA client is built.
    2. :func:`announce_cpu_collectives` -- after (1), because it reads the
       RESOLVED ``JAX_PLATFORMS``; before any collective, because gloo's
       reduce-scatter corrupts silently and the operator has to learn that
       before the run, not after.
    3. :func:`skip_gpu_plugin_discovery` -- idempotent re-arm; the last
       point at which the CUDA dlopen (76.9 s cold, job 7882076) can still
       be avoided.
    4. :func:`init_jax_distributed` -- one ``jax.distributed.initialize()``
       per process, guarded by an env sentinel that survives re-imports.
    5. :func:`fallback_to_cpu_if_no_gpu_backend` -- THIS is the first
       ``jax.devices()``, i.e. backend init.  After it the platform and the
       allocator are frozen and ``os.environ`` stops being evidence.
       Demotes to CPU only when no GPU is physically present; a cuda-init
       failure ON a GPU node is re-raised, never masked.

       (2)-(5) are ``bootstrap()``, unchanged and still separately tested;
       this function calls it rather than re-listing its steps, so there is
       exactly one implementation of the order.
    6. :func:`common.collectives.prepare_mesh` -- the run's mesh, then
       ``warm_mesh_cliques`` (CPU/MPI) and ``nccl_warmup`` (GPU/NCCL).
       Collective: every rank must reach it.  Needs (4) and (5).
    6b. :func:`_enforce_required_ffi` -- the FFI layer is REQUIRED
       (decisions.md 2026-08-01): each gate's :meth:`ffi.gate.Gate.enforce`
       runs against the fresh mesh, so a missing or unloadable FFI library
       refuses AT STARTUP, naming the ``.so`` and the fix, instead of at
       the first kernel factory mid-run; an explicit ``=0`` either refuses
       (deleted duplicate) or announces the uncertified opt-out here.
       Needs (6): the refusal/announce vocabulary is mesh-platform-aware.
    7. ``ensure_jax_compile_cache`` -- needs ``jax.process_count()`` from
       (4)/(5), and its P>1 agreement layer rides the coordination service
       that (4) started.  Deliberately AFTER (6): the clique warm-up's jit
       must stay the small, sequentially-executed program that makes the
       warm-up work at all, and running it before the cache layer is
       installed keeps that measured behaviour byte-identical.
    8. The startup report -- LAST, because it reads the live client, and
       the live client does not exist until (5).

    Parameters
    ----------
    platform
        ``"gpu"`` (default; JAX_PLATFORMS=``cuda,cpu``, so a GPU-less node
        demotes) or ``"cpu"`` (forced).  The ``cpu`` in ``cuda,cpu`` is
        load-bearing: ``solvers/lanczos.py`` uses ``jax.debug.callback``,
        which needs a local CPU device, so ``JAX_PLATFORMS=cuda`` alone
        breaks BSE.
    axis_names
        The mesh axis names.  Everything in-tree uses ``('x','y')``.
    print_fn
        Where the report goes; default is a rank-0-gated ``print``.

    Idempotent.  Drivers import each other (``python -m gw.gw_jax`` re-imports
    ``gw.gw_jax`` through ``gw_init``), so the second call must not build a
    second mesh -- it returns the first :class:`RuntimeStack`.  A second call
    asking for DIFFERENT ``axis_names`` is not a re-entry, it is a request for
    a second mesh, and it RAISES rather than silently handing back the first.

    Why this exists (measured, not conjectured).  jax registers an atexit
    hook (``jax._src.api.clean_up``) that destroys every backend client at
    interpreter exit.  After a run that cold-compiled its whole program set
    in-process (~195 XLA:CPU compiles on the fastloop mini-deck), that
    destructor deadlocks in its thread-pool shutdown: the main thread parks
    in a futex join and ~53 ``tf_XLAEigen`` pool workers are left spinning
    on-CPU, indefinitely — 20 minutes measured before the harness timeout
    (jobs 7884928, 7884989 phases 0a/0b; thread census in the 7884989
    artifacts).  Every Python-side duty (the driver's timing table, the
    compile-cache atexit report) completes FIRST; the block is pure C++
    teardown, unreachable from here, and warm runs (0 in-process compiles)
    never hit it — 6 clean bare runs across every FFI dial combination
    (jobs 7884986/7884987).

    So this function performs each remaining teardown duty explicitly, in
    order, and then ends the process with ``os._exit`` so the interpreter
    finalization that would run the deadlocking destructor never starts:

    1. ``jax.effects_barrier()`` — drains the runtime tokens that jax's own
       ``wait_for_tokens`` atexit would have drained.
    2. ``atexit.unregister(jax._src.api.clean_up)`` — the deadlocking hook.
    3. ``jax.distributed.shutdown()`` — the piece of ``clean_up`` that must
       still happen (P>1 coordination service; a no-op at P=1).
    4. ``atexit._run_exitfuncs()`` — every remaining registered duty runs

    the bare interpreter exit hung.  Call it from a driver's ``__main__``
