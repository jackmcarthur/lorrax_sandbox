"""kin+ion computation: T + V_loc + V_NL (+ V_H) for all k → kin_ion.h5.

**By default this writes TWO datasets** and never mixes them:

``kin_ion``   (nk, nb, nb) — ``T + V_loc + V_NL``, **pristine**.
``v_hartree`` (nk, nb, nb) — the exact FFT-grid ⟨mk|V_H|nk⟩, Ry.

Keeping them apart is what makes one file serve every consumer: the same
``kin_ion.h5`` feeds a run that wants the exact V_H (``hartree_source=
stored``) and one that wants the ISDF quadrature (``isdf``), the VH
column of ``sigma_diag.dat`` stops reading 0.000 by construction, and a
QSGW band rotation gets the **full matrix** rather than a diagonal it
cannot transform.  At 12×12 / 80 bands the extra array is ~15 MB.

``--no-hartree`` skips V_H entirely (ionic-only file, ISDF route
mandatory).  ``--fold-hartree`` reproduces the legacy pre-``v_hartree``
format that added V_H *into* ``kin_ion`` and stamped ``has_hartree=True``;
it exists only to regenerate old artifacts bit-for-bit.

Which V_H source to use — read this before trusting an eqp number
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``H₀ = ⟨T+V_ion+V_NL⟩ + ⟨V_H⟩`` is a catastrophic cancellation: for MoS₂
the two terms are −502 eV and +461 eV and their sum is −42 eV, so V_H's
*relative* accuracy is H₀'s accuracy in absolute eV.

* **stored / gspace (exact FFT-grid).**  ⟨mk|V_H|nk⟩ through the same
  ``compute_local_V_k`` route V_loc takes: analytically exact and
  centroid-count independent.  Pinned to QE's ``kih.dat`` at rms
  1e-4 eV.  Built by ONE distributed kernel
  (:func:`compute_hartree_matrix`) shared by this CLI, the driver's
  ``gspace`` route and the QSGW loop: ρ is partitioned over
  (k, band-chunk) and reduced with a single 1.4 MB psum, the Poisson
  solve is replicated on purpose, and ⟨mk|V_H|nk⟩ is partitioned over
  k with no reduction at all.  It strong-scales; see scorecard §X.
* **isdf (V_q[0] tile).**  Costs nothing extra, inherits the GW run's
  full P-way distribution, recomputable in-loop for QSGW.  Measured vs
  the exact route (MoS₂, scorecard §S.5): ~1 % on the occupied manifold
  at 6 centroids per ζ-fit band, 0.11–0.20 % from 9 c/band upward —
  where it **plateaus** (2.5× more centroids, and a 1e-12 rank cutoff
  instead of 1e-8, each buy <5 % relative).

The plateau is why the exact sources exist.  A 0.5 % V_H error is 2 eV
of H₀, and the VBM and CBM errors do not cancel: on the MoS₂ 12×12 at
606 centroids the ISDF route is 0.54 % rms over the occupied manifold
and that is +1.91 eV on the VBM and −2.25 eV on the CBM at K — **4.15 eV
on the band gap**.  50 meV QP energies need V_H to ~1e-4 relative, two
orders past the plateau.

Every physical convention is inherited from the run's own input deck
(``sys_dim`` → Coulomb truncation, ``nval``/``ncond``/``nband`` → band
window, ``bispinor``, the WFN's FFT grid), and the resolved values are
stamped into the output so the generator and the GW run cannot silently
disagree.  ``--sys_dim`` may only *confirm* the deck, never contradict it.

#                     (1.4 MB at 12×12).  Nothing else is reduced.
#   V_H(r) = Poisson  **REPLICATED BY DESIGN** — zero collectives; see the
#                     step-2 comment inside ``compute_hartree_matrix``.
#   ⟨mk|V_H|nk⟩       partitioned over k, each k computed rank-locally with
#                     NO cross-rank reduction (a k block is independent);
#                     combined by one ~15-35 MB all-gather.
#   ψ                 loaded per rank for the (k, band) windows that rank
#                     owns — process-local, never a global sharded array,
#                     so the I/O scales with P too and no collective is
#                     implied by the load.
#
# Why the partitions differ between the two sweeps: ρ is a sum over
# (k, band) and both axes are free, whereas ⟨mk|V_H|nk⟩ contracts the FULL
# band window against itself at fixed k, so bands cannot be split without
# introducing a reduction.  k is the axis both share, and it is the one the
# dominant sweep (matrix elements, 1.05e12 of the 1.2e12 flops at 12×12)
# needs.  Band chunking is layered on top of the ρ sweep only when P > nk,
# which is the only regime where k alone stops filling the machine.

    ψ process-locally for exactly those windows, and accumulates into
    its own full-grid partial ρ.  ρ is *small* — ``nx·ny·nz`` f64,
    1.4 MB for the MoS₂ 12×12 — so replicating the accumulator costs
    nothing and the combination is a single all-reduce of that size.
    Sharding ρ itself would buy 1.4 MB of memory and cost an
    all-to-all; it is deliberately not done.

    The FFT flops (nk·nocc 3-D FFTs, 1.1e11 at 12×12) divide by P
    exactly, and so does the ψ read.  The pad-band contract is
    irrelevant here because the items carry real band bounds, not
    mesh-rounded ones.

    Mirrors :func:`psp.get_DFT_mtxels.compute_valence_density` — SAME
    per-k quadrature helper, no second copy of the density math — and
    never holds more than one ``(k, band-chunk)`` of ψ, which is what
    keeps the 144-k / 400-band decks inside a node.  The unfolded full
    BZ carries uniform weights ``1/nk_tot`` by construction
    (``SymMaps`` expands the IBZ to the full mesh), so no ``kweights``
    lookup is needed.

    THE QSGW SEAM — ``psi_rotation``
    --------------------------------
    ``None`` (default, and the only thing a one-shot run needs) builds ρ
    from the WFN file's DFT orbitals.

    Pass ``(nk, nmix, nocc)`` and ρ is built instead from the CURRENT
    occupied orbitals ``ψ^cur_n = Σ_m U[k, m, n] ψ^DFT_m`` — i.e. from
    whatever mixed/rotated wavefunctions the SC loop is holding, which
    is what makes an updated-density QSGW iteration possible rather
    than a fixed-mean-field one.  This is the *density-side* twin of
    ``sigma_dispatch``'s ``hartree_basis_rotation``, and the two are
    orthogonal by construction: this one changes WHICH density V_H is
    generated by; that one changes which BASIS the resulting operator
    is expressed in.  The matrix-element sweep still uses the file's
    DFT orbitals, so the kernel keeps returning a DFT-basis operator
    and the existing ``U†·O_DFT·U`` seam still applies unchanged.

    With a rotation supplied the band axis is NOT chunked (the mixing
    couples all ``nmix`` bands, so a band split would need its own
    reduction); the sweep stays k-partitioned, which is full-rate for
    every P ≤ nk.
