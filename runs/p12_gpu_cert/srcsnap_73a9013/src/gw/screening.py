"""Screening-frequency planner + executor.

Each Σ scheme declares the (ω, role) pairs at which W must be available;
a generic :func:`compute_screening` turns that declaration into a
``{role → W_q}`` dict that the Σ build consumes.  Decouples *which* W's
are needed from *how* Σ is built so adding a new self-energy scheme is
a two-line change:

    1. Extend :func:`screening_requests_for` with the (ω, role) tuples
       the new scheme needs.
    2. Add a dispatch case in :func:`gw.sigma_dispatch.compute_sigma_xc`
       that reads ``W_by_role[role]`` and produces a
       :class:`~gw.sigma_dispatch.SigmaResult`.

No retrofitting of the SC iteration map or main driver is required.

Conventional roles
------------------
``"static"``  W(ω = 0).  Universal — every screened scheme needs it.
``"probe"``   Probe-frequency W for two-point fits:

              * GN-PPM:  ω = i · ω_p   (imag axis)
              * HL-PPM:  Ω = ω_p       (real axis, above all transitions)

Future schemes will introduce their own role labels (e.g.
``"imag_<i>"`` for full-imaginary-axis CD, or ``"real_grid"`` for direct
real-axis Σ on a frequency mesh).  Roles are symbolic — the Σ builder
looks them up by string, so no enum/registry retrofit is needed.

# rank-0 gate as ``LORRAX_TIMING_TRACE``, and the same node names in the

    One cadence for EVERY W role: AOT compile split (chi.compile /
    chi.exec / W.compile / W.exec), ``block_until_ready`` discipline, and
    the χ₀ donation contract are defined here exactly once.  The static
    role runs the IBZ cascade; the probe roles call this same function
    with ``force_full_bz=True`` (see :func:`compute_screening`'s
    frozen-golden note), so the stage rows stay directly comparable and a
    cadence/donation change cannot fork between the two paths.

    IBZ cascade for the Dyson solve: V_q and χ₀_q are sliced to IBZ rows
    before :func:`gw.w_isdf.solve_w` so the per-q Cholesky/LU factor runs
    only on ``n_q_ibz`` blocks; W_q comes out at IBZ shape and is unfolded
    back to the full BZ via the SAME helper V_q uses (same physics — W is
    bilinear in centroids and rotates by centroid double-permute + L-phase
    + TRS conj under sym).  Explicit-full-BZ debug bypass
    (``LORRAX_FORCE_FULL_BZ=1``) matches the V_q gate and is ANNOUNCED
    when it flips this decision; IBZ activation otherwise depends only on
    orbit-closure of the centroid set (checked downstream in
    ``_resolve_ibz_q_list``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    wfns
        ``Wavefunctions`` bundle (DFT or current-QP basis).
    V_q : (nq, μ, μ) jax.Array
        Bare Coulomb in flat-q ISDF basis, ``P(None, 'x', 'y')``.
    quad, e_ref
        Minimax quadrature (static, or a single-frequency probe quad from
        ``build_imag_quadrature`` / ``build_real_quadrature``) + energy
        reference from ``minimax_screening.build_static_quadrature``.
    sym, centroid_indices
        Symmetry tables + ISDF centroid set for the IBZ resolve (unused
        when the full-BZ route is taken).
    config, meta, mesh_xy
        Standard driver scaffolding.
    role
        Label used in the announced cadence lines (``W[<role>] ...``).
    force_full_bz
        Skip the IBZ cascade unconditionally (the probe roles' deliberate
        frozen-golden route).  Independent of the ``LORRAX_FORCE_FULL_BZ``
        debug env bypass, which additionally forces the static role.
    section
        Timing/trace node name — ``chi0_W`` (static) or ``chi0_W_probe``,
        so the two roles keep separate rows in the end-of-run stage table.
    fused_probe_chi
        Probe-χ₀ reuse (``ppm_probe_chi_reuse=auto``): a tuple
        ``(tau_full, alpha_static_row, alpha_probe_row)`` from
        ``minimax_screening.refit_imag_alpha_augmented``.  The χ build
        runs the multi-output kernel over ``tau_full`` — ONE τ sweep, two
        accumulators — and the function returns ``(W_q, chi0_probe_q)``
        with ``chi0_probe_q`` the full-BZ probe χ₀ (never IBZ-sliced,
        never donated here).  Row 0 is the static weights zero-padded
        onto the extra nodes, so the static χ is numerically the static
        quadrature.
    chi0_override
        Skip the χ build entirely and use this precomputed full-BZ χ₀
        (the probe role consuming the reused χ).  Mutually exclusive with
        ``fused_probe_chi``.  The override buffer IS donated into the
        Dyson solve, matching the computed-χ contract.

    Returns
    -------
    W_q : (nq_full, μ, μ) jax.Array

    quadrature ``quad`` and runs through :func:`compute_static_w` — the
    IBZ fast path (slice → per-q Dyson solve on the wedge → unfold).
    Non-static roles build a single-frequency quadrature on the fly
    using the existing :func:`gw.minimax_screening.build_imag_quadrature` /
    :func:`gw.minimax_screening.build_real_quadrature` helpers (chosen by whether
    ``omega_ry`` is on the imag or real axis) and solve on the full BZ
    directly: the nonlinear PPM fit downstream has a documented ~0.1 meV
    q-set path-dependence (see ``test_ibz_full_bz_equivalence``), so the
    probe W stays on the frozen-golden full-BZ path until that is
    re-frozen deliberately.

    The static minimax interval ``[x_min, x_max]`` is reused for both
    branches — both probe-quad builders take the same ``quad`` argument
    as the interval source.

    Caller is responsible for matching roles to its Σ build's
    expectations; an unrequested role lookup is a KeyError.
