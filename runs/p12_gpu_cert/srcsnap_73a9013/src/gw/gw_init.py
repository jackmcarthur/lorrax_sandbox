	   ``None`` and the guard silently passed on exactly the files it was
	   written to protect.  Both names are probed now.
	2. **``zeta_is_done``.**  The writer stamps this ``False`` up front and
	   flips it via ``mark_zeta_done`` only after the last chunk lands.  It
	   was written but never read by anybody, so a ζ from a job that died
	   mid-write (the campaign produced several) was indistinguishable on

	Also excluded: the centroid table itself.  It is already on disk in
