"""Mode-orthogonal Σ_xc dispatch.

A single entry point :func:`compute_sigma_xc` that the QSGW iteration
map calls regardless of compute mode (X_ONLY, COHSEX, GN_PPM, HL_PPM).
The dispatch decides which Σ kernel runs internally; the iteration map
sees one signature and one result type.

Returned :class:`SigmaResult` always contains ``v_h_kij_ry``,
``sigma_x_kij_ry``, and a single ``sigma_xc_kij_ry`` representing the
total exchange-correlation contribution to ``H_QP = kin_ion + V_H +
Σ_xc``.  PPM-mode-only diagnostics (full ω-grid Σ_c, on-shell diagonals,
head decomposition) live as optional fields and are populated only when
the mode produces them.

This module owns *no compute* of its own — every kernel lives under
``cohsex_sigma`` (static channels), ``ppm_pipeline`` (dynamic Σ_c) or
``qsgw_utils`` (the QSGW Hermitisation).  It only orchestrates.

#: (kin_ion path, b0, b3, resolved source, mesh identity) →
#: (source, V_H (nk,nb,nb) Ry | None).  Mesh identity is the STABLE
#: shape/axis/device-id tuple from :func:`_mesh_cache_key`, not ``id()``.
#: The QSGW loop calls ``compute_sigma_xc`` once per SC iteration and the
#: exact V_H does not change with the band basis (it is a fixed operator in
#: the DFT basis, and ``rotate_wavefunctions`` handles the basis change on
#: H₀ as a whole), so re-reading — or worse, re-running the ``gspace``
#: build, every iteration would be pure waste.
#:
#: WHAT THE CACHE ASSUMES, AND WHEN IT MUST BE DROPPED.  The statement
#: above is exactly true for QSGW **at fixed density** — the only kind the
#: driver runs today: the SC loop rotates the band basis, it does not
#: rebuild ρ.  A density-updating QSGW breaks the assumption, because then
#: V_H is a function of the current occupied orbitals and *does* change
#: every iteration.  The kernel is ready for that
#: (``compute_hartree_matrix(..., psi_rotation=U[:, :, :nocc])`` builds ρ
#: from the rotated ψ) and the cost is affordable — see the QSGW readiness
#: note in the scorecard — but such a loop MUST call
#: :func:`invalidate_hartree_cache` at the top of each iteration, or it
#: will silently keep iteration 0's Hartree potential for ever.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mode
        Compute-mode pivot.  Determines which Σ kernel chain runs and
        which roles in ``W_by_role`` are consulted.
    wfns
        ``Wavefunctions`` bundle in the *current* QP basis (or DFT basis
        for the iter-0 / one-shot call).
    V_q
        Bare Coulomb in flat-q ISDF basis.
    W_by_role
        Screened-Coulomb dict produced by
        :func:`gw.screening.compute_screening`, keyed by symbolic role.
        Conventional roles consumed here:

        * ``"static"`` — W(ω = 0).  Used by COHSEX (Σ_SX, Σ_COH) and as
          the ω-zero anchor for the PPM two-point fit.
        * ``"probe"``  — W at the GN/HL probe frequency.  Used by PPM
          for the second fit point.

        ``X_ONLY`` ignores ``W_by_role`` entirely.  Adding a new mode
        means picking the role labels it needs in
        :func:`gw.screening.screening_requests_for` and reading them
        here — no plumbing changes elsewhere.
    e_qp_ev
        Per-(k, n) QP energies (eV) used by the PPM QSGW build to evaluate
        Σ_c(E_m, E_n).  Required for PPM modes; ignored for static.
    static_head_terms, head_resolver
        q→0 head plumbing; ``static_head_terms`` is None when ``do_G0`` is
        false in the config.
    quad, e_ref
        Static minimax quadrature for χ₀; produced by
        ``minimax_screening.build_static_quadrature`` once per W solve.
    config, meta, mesh_xy, sym, wfn, band_slices, input_dir
        Standard driver scaffolding.
    Gij
        Optional band-space occupation projector; ``None`` builds the
        default DFT-occ projector inside the static kernels.
    wfns_transverse, bispinor_v_q_path
        Bispinor Σ^B channel (transverse-centroid ψ bundle + V^{i,j}
        tile file).  Both-or-neither; Σ^B is folded into ``sig_x`` by
        the static kernels.  ``None`` for scalar runs.
    print_fn
        Rank-0-only print.
