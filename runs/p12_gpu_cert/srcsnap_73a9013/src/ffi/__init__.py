def ffi_dial_key() -> tuple:
    """The ONE cache-key component capturing every factory-time FFI dial.

    ``make_flat_k_*`` / ``make_flat_k_gw_conv`` / the ``contract_bands``
    primitive all read their backend dial (``LORRAX_FFT_FFI``,
    ``LORRAX_FFT_FFI_FUSED``, ``LORRAX_BANDS_GEMM_FFI``) at FACTORY time, so
    a kernel cache that omits the dials serves a stale backend after a
    mid-process flag flip (tests flip them; the service contract —
    ``docs/dev/flat_k_fft_service.md`` — says the dial MUST be in every
    consumer cache key).  This helper is the single owner of "which dials
    were live when this factory ran"; consumers fold the returned tuple into
    their cache keys instead of each re-listing the dials (and drifting when
    a dial is added):

        ``gw.ppm_tau_kernel``   (pipeline_key + tau cache_key)
        ``gw.cohsex_sigma._make_cohsex_kernels``
        ``gw.w_isdf._get_chi_minimax_kernel``

    All three reads are tier-1 lexical (no JAX backend init) and O(1) —
    safe in any cache-lookup path at any P.
