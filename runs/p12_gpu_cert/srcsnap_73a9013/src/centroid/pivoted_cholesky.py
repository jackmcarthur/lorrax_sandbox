"""Pivoted-Cholesky pruning of over-sampled ISDF candidate points.

Implements the q=0 candidate-pruning stage described in
``pivoted_cholesky.md`` (sandbox root). The idea: k-means gives a set of M
candidate points ``{r̃_a}`` (M > N_μ); the pair-product rows
``z_{a,(vck)} = φ*_{v,k}(r̃_a) ψ_{c,k}(r̃_a)`` define a Hermitian PSD Gram
matrix ``G^{(0)} ∈ ℂ^{M×M}``. Greedy pivoted Cholesky picks the N_μ pivots
with the largest residual Schur-complement diagonal, and the corresponding
``r̃_a`` become the final ISDF points. This is strictly better than picking
on amplitude alone because it targets the coherence structure of the
valence-conduction pair-product space the ISDF fit will actually use.

Architectural map to ``gw/isdf_fitting.py``:

    pair_density                      ←→  per-k open-spin P^{(v/c)}_{αβ}(a,b)
                                          (rank-5; same einsum at candidates
                                          r̃_a not chosen r_μ)
    gram_q0_from_pair                 ←→  q=0 cross-product (no k→q FFT)
    (nothing)                         ←→  pivoted_cholesky_select  (new)

The Gram is built row-sharded over the ``('x','y')`` mesh and the select
step runs on it in place: per iteration it costs one ``pmax`` for the
pivot value, one for the tie-break, and one ``psum`` of the (k_keep,)
pivot row — O(k_keep) comm, everything else local.  Column ``p`` needs no
collective at all, which is why the Gram is ROW-sharded.

Shapes (following the md):

    phi_val_cand   (nk, nv_eff, M)   complex  φ_{v,k}(r̃_a)
    psi_cond_cand  (nk, nc_eff, M)   complex  ψ_{c,k}(r̃_a)
    G              (M, M)            complex  Hermitian PSD
    L              (M, k_keep)       complex  Cholesky columns (padded)
    piv            (k_keep,)         int32    pivot indices (−1 past rank)
    d_final        (M,)              real     Schur-complement residuals

``nv_eff`` / ``nc_eff`` fold the spinor axis into the band axis
(nv_eff = nv_bands · nspinor), matching the md's "assume spin has already
been folded" convention.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Consumes the row-sharded G ∈ ℂ^(M×M) that ``build_gram_q0_via_loadwfns``
# produces and runs the same greedy select as ``pivoted_cholesky_select``.
# Sharded along M: each device owns (M_slab, M) of G and (M_slab, k_keep)
# of L.
#
# Collectives per iteration (one per Lloyd-like step):
#
#   pmax(local_pv, 'x')       — 1 scalar: finds the global pivot value
#   pmax(-winner_p, 'x')      — 1 int32:  breaks ties by lowest device idx
#   psum(local_Lp, 'x')       — (k_keep,) array: broadcasts L[p, :] from
#                                its owning shard to every device
#
# Total comm per iter: O(k_keep). Total over k_keep iters: O(k_keep²).
# Matmul/Schur update are local — each device does L_slab @ (scalar)
# + elementwise ops on (M_slab,)- and (M_slab, k_keep)-shaped arrays.
#
# Column access `G[:, global_p]`: because G is ROW-sharded, each device's
# local slab already contains its portion of column p — no collective.
# This is why row-sharding is preferred over column-sharding for this
# algorithm.

    Two call modes:

    * Simple ``(n_val, n_cond)`` (legacy): left window = ``(0, n_val)``,
      right window = ``(n_val, n_val + n_cond)``. This is the literal
      valence × conduction pair-product Gram used in the original assay.

    * Explicit ``(band_range_left, band_range_right)`` (gw_jax / ISDF
      convention): left = ``(b0, b3)`` = "all val + sigma cond", right =
      ``(b1, b4)`` = "sigma val + all cond". Matches the windowing used
      by ``gw_init.fit_zeta`` → ``isdf_fitting.fit_zeta_chunked_to_h5``.
      Passing ``band_norms`` additionally applies the pseudoband
      normalization ``ψ /= max(norm, 1.0)`` on both left and right
      (same clamp recipe as ``isdf_fitting.py:838-847``).

    Full-BZ unfold: one ``load_wfns.read_Gvecs_to_devices`` per window,
    ``get_sharded_wfns_centroids`` at the candidate indices, sharded
    pair densities via ``compute_pair_density_spin_traced``, combined
    with the q=0 sum via ``compute_gram_q0_from_left_right``. k-weights
    are uniform ``1 / nk_tot`` because we've unfolded.

    Args:
        wfn: open WFNReader.
        sym: matching SymMaps.
        cand_idx: (M, 3) int32 FFT-grid indices of candidate points.
            Must be a ``jnp.ndarray`` (will be ``jnp.asarray``-ed if not).
        n_val: valence-window size for the legacy mode (see above).
            Required when ``band_range_left`` is not given.
        n_cond: conduction-window size for the legacy mode. Required
            when ``band_range_left`` is not given.
        mesh_xy: 2-D device mesh with axes ``'x'`` and ``'y'``. (Other
            axis names work too, as long as both are present; the pair
            density / Gram helpers hard-code the axis names ``'x'`` and
            ``'y'`` at present — we follow that convention.)
        bispinor: if True, upcast the spin structure to 4 components
            (matches gw_jax's bispinor mode). Default False.
        verbose: print progress lines.
        band_range_left: optional explicit left window (start, end).
            When given, takes precedence over (n_val, n_cond).
        band_range_right: optional explicit right window.
        band_norms: optional (nbands,) array of band norms
            (``wfn.band_norms``) for pseudoband reweighting. When given,
            applied to both left and right ψ via
            ``ψ /= max(norm_slice, 1.0)`` before the pair-density
            einsum.

    Returns:
        G: (M, M) complex, sharded ``P('x','y')`` on the mesh — ready to
