"""Route selection for the charge-channel ζ-solve.

The charge ζ-solve has one route -- the *replicated* one -- that carries the
rank-truncation cure (``charge_zeta_solve='rank_truncate'``, the production
default).  Every other route returns a plain Cholesky factor that is **not**
rank-conditioned.  When a rank-deficient C_q is factored that way the fit
returns a ζ that is far too large, V_q rebuilds to relF O(10) instead of
O(1e-15), and Σ comes out as nonsense while every stage still reports success.

That failure is silent: the only trace is the route name in the per-q
``Computing L_q`` line.  These tests pin the route decision so a regression
cannot reintroduce it.

The regression these were written for: on a CPU backend ``gw_config`` rewrote
``distributed_cholesky=auto`` to ``'off'`` (reasoning that cuSOLVERMp is
CUDA-only), but ``'off'`` is an *override* that short-circuits the whole policy
to ``sharded_cholesky`` -- so the replicated route, which is plain dense JAX and
perfectly valid on CPU, became unreachable there.  A full MoS2 12x12 G0W0 ran to
completion with rc=0 and produced a QP gap of **-161 eV**.

Pure decision logic: no GPU and no multi-process launch required.
