"""FFI thread-pin symbol resolution: what the RTLD_DEFAULT/RTLD_NEXT drift costs.

Gate for the 2026-07-30 FFI C++ divergence audit.  Three families copied the
MKL thread-pin block and the copies drifted on the resolver line:

    cpp/scalapack/blacs_grid.h      bare dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...)
    cpp/mklfft/fft_flat_k_ffi.cc    bare dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, ...)
    cpp/mklblas/gemm_batch_ffi.cc   dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT) then dlsym(RTLD_NEXT)

They really were three independent resolutions, not one shared inline — each
is a function-local static, invisible to `strings` and visible to `nm -C`:

    $ nm -C lorrax_ffi_unified/build_host_C64/liblorrax_ffi_host.so \\
        | grep 'mkl_set_num_threads_local_ptr()::fn'
    b lorrax_ffi::mklfft::mkl_set_num_threads_local_ptr()::fn
    b lorrax_ffi::mklblas::mkl_set_num_threads_local_ptr()::fn
    u lorrax_ffi::scalapack::mkl_set_num_threads_local_ptr()::fn

WHAT THIS TEST EXISTS TO PIN DOWN.  The audit brief predicted a behavioural
consequence: "under a local-scope dlopen, GEMM would pin MKL threads and FFT
would silently not".  The first version of this test asserted exactly that
and FAILED — the bare form resolved the symbol under RTLD_LOCAL too.  The
prediction rests on the man page's summary of RTLD_DEFAULT ("the process's
global symbol scope"), which describes a caller in the MAIN EXECUTABLE.
glibc's `_dl_sym` resolves RTLD_DEFAULT against the CALLER's link-map scope,
and for a dlopen'd object that scope includes its own DT_NEEDED closure —
where libmkl_intel_lp64.so actually lives.  The two resolvers are therefore
EQUIVALENT for this symbol in every configuration reachable here, and the
extraction into cpp/common/mkl_thread_pin.h is a maintenance fix, not a
correctness fix.

So the tests below assert equivalence, across the full six-way matrix, and
the file's job is to make it loud if that ever stops being true (a different
libc, a musl container, a dlmopen namespace).  That is a real question with
a real answer, unlike the fiction the first draft encoded.

NOT-VOID CHECKS.  Two assertions here are built to fail rather than to pass:
`test_absent_symbol_resolves_to_null` pins the miss path (if it went green
by resolving something, every "found it" result would be meaningless), and
`test_dt_needed_carries_the_vendor_lib` proves the probe .so reproduces the
real library's shape instead of testing a symbol that is simply absent.

Everything is built with plain g++ against the real repo header — no MKL, no
XLA, no MPI, no container — so this runs on a login node.
