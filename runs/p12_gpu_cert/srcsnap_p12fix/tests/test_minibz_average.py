"""Committed guard for the mini-BZ Coulomb-head cell average (gw.coulomb.base).

The subtle piece is the q->0 head: BGW splits the 3D 1/q^2 singularity into an
analytic Baldereschi-Tosatti sphere term + MC of the smooth remainder outside
the inscribed sphere (Common/minibzaverage.f90:79-81).  LORRAX used to omit the
analytic term (pure Sobol), which makes the head seed-dependent.  This test
locks in the fix: the analytic-sphere head is stable across MC seeds while the
pure-Sobol head is not.  Pure-numpy, no fixture, no GPU (~seconds).

Full physical validation (point-vs-cell-avg vs arbitrary_q_bse.md §16.4b, eval_vq
bit-identity, exciton flag on/off) lives at
reports/minibz_head_averaging_2026-07-20/validate_minibz.py (needs the 6x6 fixture).
