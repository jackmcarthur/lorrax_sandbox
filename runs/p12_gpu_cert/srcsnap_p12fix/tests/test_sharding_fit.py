"""``common.sharding_fit`` — and proof that the thing it fixes is real.

The defect: ``bandstructure.bse_setup`` and ``bse.vq_interp`` shard the RAW
ISDF centroid count while ``bse.bse_io`` shards its own PADDED copy.  n_mu is a
k-means output, so on the MoS2 4x4 deck it is 785 = 5 x 157 — divisible by
neither 4 nor 8, and ``exciton_bands`` died at EVERY P>1 (job 7882476, cells
exb16s at P=16 and exb64s at P=64).

Two properties have to hold and each is worthless without its opposite:

  * when every axis divides, the fitter must return the SAME spec — otherwise
    it silently moves the HLO of every currently-working run;
  * when one does not, it must drop THAT axis and only that one.

and one fact has to be established rather than assumed: that the raw spec
really is refused by jax.  A fitter that "fixes" a non-problem would pass
every logic test above and tell you nothing.
