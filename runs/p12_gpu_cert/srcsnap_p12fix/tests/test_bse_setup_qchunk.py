"""``compute_wfns_fi``'s q-CHUNK and its two eigenvalue paths.

Covers the three things the fine-grid chunking contract promises:

1. the chunk width is an INPUT KEY (``wfn_fi_q_chunk``) whose default is
   ``N_q_co = prod(kgrid_co)`` — not a bare constant;
2. ``use_low_mem_eigh`` selects the distributed (face-sharded) eigh and
   REFUSES when it cannot be honoured, never demoting to the whole-matrix
   path it exists to avoid;
3. eigenvalues are accumulated to the FULL band count across chunks
   (``.lam_all_fi``), while ψ/coeffs stay windowed.

INSTRUMENT DISCIPLINE (README §5.1).  The value comparator used by the
chunk-invariance cells is exercised on a PLANTED deviation in
``test_chunk_invariance_comparator_goes_red`` — a chunk-invariance PASS is
only informative because that cell shows the same comparator failing.
