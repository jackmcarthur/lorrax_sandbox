"""Verify ``SymMaps.R_proper`` matches the offline-derived fixture (mod
transpose) and is real-orthogonal on every row.

The fixture lives at
``/pscratch/sd/j/jackm/lorrax_sandbox/reports/bispinor_ibz_2026-05-16/cri3_R_proper.npz``
and pairs with the math derivation
(``reports/bispinor_ibz_2026-05-16/derivation.md`` §A2).

Two convention notes (both documented inside SymMaps.__init__):

  1. The fixture uses ``O = A · U · A⁻¹`` with ``U = mtrx⁻¹`` (forward
     direct-coord rotation), i.e. ``A.T · inv(mtrx) · inv(A.T)``.  The
     LIVE code reuses ``R_cart`` (= ``A.T · mtrx · inv(A.T)``) because
     that's the rotation matrix that LORRAX's actual ``U_spinor``
     satisfies the σ-sandwich identity with.  For orthogonal mtrx the
     two are inverses (= transposes) of each other; the §A5 mixing
     formula then absorbs the transpose into its index ordering.  This
     test compares the live spatial half to ``fixture.T``.

  2. The fixture stores ``R_proper_TRS = -R_proper_spatial`` (formally
     correct from ``T σ^i T⁻¹ = -σ^i`` on i=1,2,3); the LIVE code
     stores ``R_proper_TRS = +R_proper_spatial`` because the σ-flip on
     (μ_L, ν_L) ∈ {1,2,3}² UNIQUE_TILES factorises as (−1)·(−1) = +1
     and is absorbed by the existing ``unfold_v_q`` conj-wrap
     (derivation §A4).  This test compares the spatial halves only.
