"""Gates for ``common.rank_criterion`` — the rank-truncation criterion.

Every instrument in this file is shown FAILING before it is trusted (wk_REL
README §5.1): each positive assertion is paired with a control that makes the
same check go red.  A checker that cannot go red is a void check, and this
project has nine of those on record.

Pure numpy — no jax, no WFN.  Runs on a login node.
