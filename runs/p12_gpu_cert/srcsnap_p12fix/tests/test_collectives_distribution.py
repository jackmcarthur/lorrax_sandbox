"""The distribution service in ``common.collectives``, and the promise that
``gw.kin_ion_io`` no longer reaches under it.

Every assertion here is paired with a NEGATIVE CONTROL that runs the same
instrument against input it MUST reject.  That is not decoration: three of
these checks are structural (an AST walk, an ``__all__`` audit, an import
census) and a structural check that has never fired is indistinguishable from
one that scans nothing — the failure mode that produced four cheerfully green
void checks in the 2026-07-30 session (``wk_REL/README.md`` standing lesson 1).

The single-process behaviour pinned here is the SAME behaviour the multi-rank
path degenerates to, which is why P=1 unit tests are worth having for a
distribution layer: ``psum_replicate``, ``all_gather_processes`` and
``gather_indexed_blocks`` each short-circuit at ``process_count() <= 1``, and
the short-circuit must be bit-identical to the serial answer or the P=1
reference every gate compares against is itself wrong.
