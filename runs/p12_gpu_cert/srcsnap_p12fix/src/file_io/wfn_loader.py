"""``WfnLoader`` — single entry point for ψ(G) loading.

Replaces the {WFNReader + PhdfWfnReader + SymMaps.get_cnk_fullzone[_batch] +
SymMaps.get_gvecs_kfull + load_wfns.read_Gvecs_to_devices + load_kpoint_fftbox}
mess with one class.  Caller never thinks about backend, symmetry unfold,
padding, or τ-phase.

Returns ψ in **G-flat** layout (per-k, per-band, per-spinor, ngk_max_pad-padded).
Downstream consumers compose with :mod:`common.wfn_transforms` (P3 landing
target) to get FFT-box / r-space / centroid-gather outputs.  This split
keeps the loader cheap (g_flat is ~6-11% of g_box) so band-chunk loops
never have to materialise the FFT box just to access a real-space slice.

Backends
--------
``backend='auto'`` (default) picks the lightest path that works:

- **eager** (host h5py + numpy unfold + ``device_put``): single-process,
  CPU JAX, or small files.
- **phdf5** (collective parallel-HDF5 FFI + on-device unfold): multi-rank
  GPU + 2-D mesh + FFI .so loadable.  Reuses the same union-read +
  unfold kernel that powered the legacy ``PhdfWfnReader.coeffs_gspace``
  path, but stops one step short of the FFT-box scatter so the output
  stays G-flat (the loader's defining layout).

Both backends produce **byte-identical** output for the same ``(bands, k,
sharding, bispinor)`` request — that's the P2 test contract.

Public surface
--------------
* :class:`MfHeader` attributes — same names :class:`WFNReader` exposes
  (``nkpts``, ``nbands``, ``nspinor``, ``kgrid``, ``fft_grid``, ``bvec``,
  ``sym_matrices``, ``translations``, …).  Drop-in source.
* :meth:`load` — one call: ψ array for a (band_range, k) window.
* :meth:`bands` — band-chunked iterator for GW driver loops.
* :meth:`gvecs` — cached G-vector lists per k-set.
* :meth:`ngk_valid` — per-k logical ngk (for callers that care).
* :meth:`get_gvec_nk` — deprecated thin shim for legacy vcoul / qp_wfn.

P-roadmap
---------
- P1 (this commit): eager backend; bit-match legacy WFNReader+SymMaps.
- P2: phdf5 backend; bit-match eager.
- P3: ``common/wfn_transforms.py`` (to_box / to_rbox / to_rmu / to_rchunk).
- P4: migrate consumers; delete SymMaps unfold helpers + load_wfns helpers.
- P5: delete WFNReader + PhdfWfnReader.

    """Per-rank ``counts`` table for the kchunk-union phdf5 read,
    clamped to the on-disk ``mnband_file`` band extent.

    The C++ ``read_kchunk_union`` handler computes each rank's
    band-axis file offset as
    ``offset_band = b_lo_logical + rank_coord_band * bands_per_rank``,
    where ``rank_coord_band = coord_x * p_y + coord_y`` for a 2-D
    ``('x','y')`` mesh of shape ``(p_x, p_y)``.  Without clamping,
    the tail rank can read past ``mnband_file`` whenever
    ``(b_hi_logical - b_lo_logical)`` rounded up to ``world *
    bands_per_rank`` extends past the file extent — H5Dread then
    fails with "selection + offset not within extent".

    This helper returns a ``(world * n_reads, 4) int64`` table whose
    rank ``r``-slice ``[r*n_reads:(r+1)*n_reads, :]`` has the band-axis
    count clamped to ``max(0, min(bands_per_rank, mnband_file -
    (b_lo_logical + r * bands_per_rank)))``.  Ranks fully past EOF get
    band_cnt=0 — their pinned-buffer pre-zero (in the C++ worker)
    becomes a zero-filled rank tile, which is the correct semantics for
    band-pad rows.

    Sharded on the leading axis by ``('x','y')`` so each rank's
    shard_map-local view is the ``(n_reads, 4)`` slice for its own
    rank.  Rank-flattening matches the C++: outer loop over ``r``
    in 0..world-1 corresponds to ``coord_x = r // p_y,
    coord_y = r % p_y`` (leftmost-is-slowest in JAX's convention).

        #     pairs present in the file.  That identity involves NO
        #     symmetry operation, NO fractional translation τ, NO umklapp
        #     vector and NO ``U_spinor`` — so it is an INDEPENDENT check
        #     on the unfold, not a restatement of it.  Derivation (T1)-(T5)
        #     in ``common/density_symmetry_check.py``.
        #   * ALSO MEASURED: that each claimed ``{S|τ}`` really leaves ρ
        #     invariant.  Because ρ is a spinor TRACE, ``U_spinor`` and the
        #     τ-phase cancel out of it, so this arm validates ``mtrx`` and
        #     ``tnp`` only.
        #   * NOT MEASURED: ``U_spinor`` and the τ-phase used by
        #     ``unfold_psi`` (they cancel in ρ, see above), and TRS for
        #     ``nspin == 2`` decks (this reader has no spin axis — coeffs
        #     axis 1 is the spinor axis everywhere, so the two collinear
        #     channels are not addressable and the check says so).

        ``jax.local_devices()[0]``.  ``nb = bands[1] - bands[0]``
        exactly: **no mesh-divisibility band padding**, because nothing
        about this array is global.

        How it differs from :meth:`load` — and why that matters
        -------------------------------------------------------
        :meth:`load` always returns a *global* array: every rank must
        request the SAME ``(bands, k)`` window and each ends up owning a
        band shard of one logical object.  That is the right primitive
        for the GW pipeline, and the wrong one for any kernel whose
        parallelism is over k, because rank *r* asking for ``k=[7]``
        while rank *s* asks for ``k=[9]`` builds a global array whose
        shards are pieces of different physical objects.

        This method is the other primitive: the array it returns is
        addressable by this process only, so each rank may load a
        DIFFERENT ``(bands, k)`` window and run ordinary ``jax.jit``
        computations on it with no collective, no barrier and no
        cross-rank shape agreement.  Combining the per-rank results is
        then an explicit, auditable step (one ``psum`` / one
        ``process_allgather``) rather than something XLA's SPMD
        partitioner infers.

        Used by the exact-V_H kernel (``gw.kin_ion_io``), whose ρ sweep
        and ⟨mk|V_H|nk⟩ sweep are both partitioned over k.

        Identical values to ``load(..., sharding=None)`` on a mesh-less
        loader — same ``_eager_build``, same symmetry unfold — so a P=1
        run is bit-for-bit what the serial path produced.
