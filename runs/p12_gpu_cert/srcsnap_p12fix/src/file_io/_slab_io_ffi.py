"""FFI SlabIO backend — collective MPI-IO via ``ffi.phdf5``.

FIRST tier of the ``slab_io = auto`` capability router on BOTH JAX
backends (``gw_config._route_cpu_slab_io`` / ``_route_gpu_slab_io``:
PHDF5_FFI → PHDF5_HOST → H5PY_ALLGATHER), also selectable explicitly
via ``slab_io = phdf5_ffi``.  The legacy ``use_ffi_io`` boolean no
longer routes here: ``true`` is a deprecated no-op, ``false`` forces
the allgather backend.  Imported lazily by :mod:`file_io.slab_io` so
the fallback tiers work without ``liblorrax_ffi*.so`` being built.

PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC.  Nothing in this module is CUDA-specific: the
``jax.ffi.ffi_call`` sites name only the target string, and
``ffi_loader`` registers ``liblorrax_ffi.so``'s handlers under
platform="CUDA" and ``liblorrax_ffi_host.so``'s under platform="cpu"
against those same strings.  So this backend drives the GPU collective
write and (since workstream AE) the host one — on CPU the C++ side
skips the D2H staging entirely and H5Dwrite reads the XLA buffer in
place.  ``gw_config._route_cpu_slab_io`` capability-probes for it.

Every operation derives per-rank hyperslab offsets from the sharding
spec of the JAX array being written (or a caller-provided one for
reads) plus a global-origin ``offset`` argument.  The C++ handler
un-ravels the rank id through ``mesh_shape`` and advances along every
sharded dim.  See ``ffi/cpp/phdf5/write_ffi.cc`` for the C++ side.

        # (Python main thread) of ``jit(...)(A)`` until the Future
        # resolves — i.e. until ``H5Dwrite`` completes.  By doing the
        # jit on a dedicated Python worker thread, we leave the main
        # Python thread free to build the next chunk while the current
        # one is still writing.  One worker per backend (FIFO) ensures
        # every rank dispatches in the same order, which is the MPI-IO
        # collective rendezvous requirement.  See
        # ``reports/session_2026-04-18_async_probe/report.md``.
        # Compiled shard_map cache lives at module level — see
        # ``_get_read_sm`` / ``_get_write_sm``.  Instance no longer
        # carries its own ``_sm_cache``; the module-level lru_cache is
        # shared across all _FfiBackend instances, so re-opening the
        # same (or another) file with matching FFI signature reuses
        # the cached compile.
        # Bound the write-dispatch queue to prevent GPU memory growth
        # across chunks.  Each queued ``_task`` closure captures its
        # input ``A`` (the jax.Array being written) by Python reference
        # — XLA's allocator counts A as live-in-use until the closure
        # runs and returns.  With H5Dwrite at ~11 s per chunk and
        # chunk-compute at ~1-2 s, an unbounded queue grows ~1 task per
        # chunk at steady state: each chunk's A accumulates on GPU and
        # ``bytes_in_use`` rises by ~1 zeta_chunk/rank/chunk until OOM.
        #
        # Total in-flight A-holding at queue-cap K = (K queued +
        # 1 being processed + 1 in main-thread transpose view).
        # Throughput cost vs unbounded is small above K=2; writer is
        # already the bottleneck on typical H5Dwrite rates.
        #
        # Measured at Si 4x4x4 60Ry / 2400c / mem16:
        #   K=0 unbounded: 12.91 → 22.48+ GB / 28 s zeta_fit (OOM-bound)
        #   K=2:           12.91 → 16.47 GB (flat) / 97 s zeta_fit
        #   K=4:           12.91 → 18.50 GB (flat) / 92 s zeta_fit
