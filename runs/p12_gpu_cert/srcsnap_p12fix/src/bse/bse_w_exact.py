"""Exact W_c(omega) via shifted solves with the non-TDA RPA density resolvent.

Cross-validates the GW screened Coulomb.  In the ISDF centroid (density) basis
the screened interaction obeys the Casida resolvent identity

    W(omega) - v  =  v (omega - H_RPA)^{-1} v            (omega = 0: static W0)

where H_RPA is the NON-TDA symplectic RPA (test-charge) density-response
Hamiltonian with the bare-exchange RING kernel V (the B1 dense k-summed form):

    H_RPA = [[ D + V ,   V   ],
             [  -V   , -D - V ]]

V sits in BOTH blocks — the RPA ring coupling K^A = (1/Nk)<M_t|v|M_t'>
(``build_bse_ring_matvec_full(..., screening=True)``), NOT the excitonic V_B of
Henneke Eq. 2-20.  This is the test-charge screening whose resolvent resums the
RPA bubble chi = chi0 (1 - v chi0)^{-1}; the exciton V_B kernel is a different
response and does NOT reproduce W (it overshoots the q=0 tile by ~1.8x).  The GW
W is full-RPA, not TDA — dropping the -V/Y block (TDA) fails by construction.

Convention (verified bit-for-bit against the folded static RPA and the on-disk
``W0_qmunu - V_qmunu`` q=0 tile to ~2e-9 — see the "W(0) resolvent cross-check"
section of reports/bse_refactor_map_2026-07-15/PHASE2_LOG.md):

  * Probe column nu: g = e_nu in centroid space; the transition generator applies
    v then the pair-density vertex, f = M^dag (v e_nu)
    (``build_realspace_random_transition_generator``) — the RIGHT vertex of v X v.
  * RHS is that same f with a minus on the anti-resonant (Y) block: rhs = [f; -f]
    (density super-vertex [rho; -rho]; the ring coupling makes the excitation and
    de-excitation vertices coincide, so both blocks carry the SAME f).
  * Shifted solve x = (z - H_RPA)^{-1} rhs at z = (omega + i eta)/Ry via GMRES.
  * Readout s = x[0] + x[1] = X + Y; the density-snapshot vertex applies the pair
    density then v: w_c(mu) = v (M s) = [v chi v]_{mu,nu} = column nu of W - v.

The generator/snapshot k-SUM the pair densities, so the reconstructed tile is the
q=0 block.  H_RPA carries no q=0 head (vhead/whead are a separate rank-1 piece);
``--compare-w0`` loads head-LESS bodies on both sides (``inject_head=False``) and
compares body-to-body.

    Computes ``W(omega) - v`` tiles from the non-TDA RPA density-response

    columns at once, and is the single shared implementation behind
    ``--compare-w0`` today and the future Lanczos-chain ``W(omega)`` model.

    Data flow (the three-stage seam the future model reuses verbatim):

      1. SEED (zeta -> pair, batched, ``gen`` shard_map).  Each probe column
         ``nu`` is a density-space vector ``g``; the transition generator applies
         ``v`` then the pair-density vertex, ``f = M^dag (v g)``, and the non-TDA
         RHS is the density super-vertex ``[f; -f]`` (both blocks carry the same
         ``f`` — the ring coupling makes excitation/de-excitation vertices
         coincide).  Output pair-basis block ``sh.X_full`` = ``(2, nu, c_X, v_Y, k)``,
         with ``nu`` a REPLICATED batch axis (the pair basis already tiles c on x
         and v on y — the probe axis has no free mesh axis and stays replicated
         through the solve; only the boundaries carry it as a shardable index).

      2. SOLVE (operator application).  Per-column-independent shifted GMRES via
         ``lax.scan`` over the probe axis — one Krylov subspace alive at a time
         (no N-way unrolled slot pile-up), bit-identical to the per-column loop
         it replaces because the GMRES norm/least-squares reductions are global
         per single column.  The scan stacks the readouts ``s = x[0] + x[1]``
         into ``sh.X`` = ``(nu, c_X, v_Y, k)`` and the per-column relative
         residuals.  Runs inside the cached, jitted :func:`_get_block_gmres_solver`
         engine with the q/omega-dependent tensors (``rhs``, ``diag_h``, ``z``,
         ``matvec_operands``) as RUNTIME ARGUMENTS, so it compiles ONCE per
         operator structure and every later q / omega is dispatch-only.

      3. PROJECT (pair -> zeta, batched, reduce-scatter ``snapshot``).  The
         density-snapshot vertex applies the pair density then ``v``,
         ``w(mu) = v (M s)``, and — because ``snapshot`` was built with
         ``scatter_nu_on_y=True`` — reduce-scatters the ``nu`` batch onto ``y``
         while completing the V_q0 contraction, emitting the tile directly as
         ``W(mu_X, nu_Y)`` = ``sh.V``.  No replicated ``(mu, nu)`` is ever formed.

    Block-Lanczos plug-in (future W(omega), do NOT build here).  The screening
    matvec (``build_bse_ring_matvec_full(screening=True)``) is symmetric under
    the symplectic metric, so a single block-Lanczos run seeded with the SAME
    stage-1 pair-basis block ``rhs`` (the v-probe seeds) tridiagonalizes the
    screening operator ONCE; every ``omega`` is then a small
    ``(T - z)^{-1}`` resolvent on the projected tridiagonal, and the moments are
    projected back to the zeta basis by the SAME stage-3 ``snapshot``.  Only the
    stage-2 middle swaps (scan-of-GMRES -> one block-Lanczos + per-omega tiny
    solves); stages 1 and 3 — the reshard boundaries — are reused unchanged.
    Keep any such model calling THIS function's seed/project so the layout stays
    single-sourced.

    Builds ONE block-Lanczos chain (:func:`w_omega_chain.build_w_omega_chain`) at

    ``freqs_ev`` (each ``omega + i eta`` in eV — covers the static ``omega=0``,

    also reports closure against the on-disk ``disk_tile`` (``W0 - V``), the GW
    ground truth.  Prints a per-omega convergence table (rel_err vs chain length)
    and a timing / omega-count break-even summary (the whole point: amortize the
    chain build over many frequencies).  Returns a results dict for the gate.

    ``cols`` are the probe density columns (``T``-largest + random mix); the chain
    block width is ``p = len(cols)``.  ``disk_tile`` / ``nlog`` are the head-less
