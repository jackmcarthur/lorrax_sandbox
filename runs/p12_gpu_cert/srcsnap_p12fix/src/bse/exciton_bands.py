"""Exciton bandstructure E_S(Q) along a high-symmetry Q path (TDA).

Finite-momentum TDA BSE ``H_Q = D_Q + V_Q − W`` in the pair basis
``|v k, c k+Q⟩`` (LORRAX convention: electron leg shifted by +Q), solved at
every Q of a user-supplied high-symmetry path with ONE compiled engine:

  * **Q path** — read from the SAME ``K_POINTS crystal_b`` block (QE-style,
    labels via ``#``) that the htransform bandstructure driver consumes;
    parsing / node labels / path-distance accumulation reuse
    ``bandstructure.htransform`` (``generate_kpath_from_qe_segments`` /
    ``initialize_kpath``).  One path format in the package.
  * **ψ_c(k+Q, r_μ), ε_c(k+Q)** — htransform (``bse_setup.compute_wfns_fi``
    with an explicit q-list = {k + Q}): mutually consistent eigenpairs of
    one interpolated fH_{k+Q}; no shifted NSCF, no Sternheimer
    (arbitrary_q_bse.md §1/§2a-b).  htransform returns cell-periodic u at
    wrapped labels — the same torus convention as the stored grid ψ.  The fH
    is built over the FULL loaded band window (all valence + all conduction of
    the input, e.g. nband=40 = 26v+14c), EXACTLY as the standard SP
    bandstructure driver builds it; the BSE conduction bands are a sub-window
    returned interior to it, guarded above by the extra conduction bands so no
    selection boundary cuts a near-degenerate pair.  Running on a sliver
    conduction window instead makes the off-grid caches ring 100-1000 meV
    (spurious exciton dips); use a full-band input.
  * **Direct kernel W(k−k')** — UNCHANGED coarse tiles + coarse-k FFT
    convolution (all k-differences stay on-grid when every conduction leg
    shifts by the same Q; §2c per-element verification).  The matvec is the
    ONE production trial-stack matvec (``bse_stack_matvec``) with the
    conduction slots holding the Q-shifted caches — no parallel kernel.
  * **Exchange V_Q** — from ``bse.vq_interp``:
      ``--vq-mode=interp``  F-scheme + b26p interpolation (fast; ONE jitted
                            evaluator, per-Q dispatch-only), or
      ``--vq-mode=refit``   per-Q ζ refit (compute-don't-interpolate — the
                            off-grid GROUND TRUTH; expensive), or
      ``--vq-mode=both``    interp on the full path + refit on
                            ``--refit-points`` spot checks, solved in the
                            SAME compiled scan (extra scan rows) so the
                            interp-vs-refit ΔE_S table is apples-to-apples.
    Momentum labeling: the pair density conj(ψ_c[k+Q]) ψ_v[k] pairs with
    the tile at TILE momentum q = wrap(−Q) (reference-metric convention,
    ``vq_interp`` docstrings); on-grid this is exactly the stored
    ``V_qmunu[wrap(−Q)]`` slot.
  * **Γ endpoint** — at exactly Γ the production q=0 tile is used (stored
    head-body convention: compute_vcoul zeroes G=0, the mini-BZ-averaged
    head is the loader's rank-1 injection).  At every finite Q the G=0 term
    of v(Q+G) is KEPT (BGW ``energy_loss`` convention; finite_q_bse.md) —
    the physical nonanalytic exchange branch, so E(Q→0) need not equal
    E(Γ) on the longitudinal states.  Both facts are written into the .dat
    header.
  * **THE SCAN** — the per-Q solve (hoisted pair amplitudes + block-Lanczos
    over the stack matvec) is one jitted function ``lax.scan``-ned over the
    whole Q list: ONE compile serves every Q (verified by the
    JAX_LOG_COMPILES census; per-q-recompile lesson, PHASE2_LOG).
    Interpolated V_Q are Hermitized (0.5(V+V^H)) — commutes with the pair
    contraction; the anti-Hermitian residue is stencil noise.

Outputs: ``<prefix>.dat`` (path distance, Q, lowest n_eig in eV, labeled
header; refit rows flagged) and ``<prefix>.png`` (bands along the path,
high-symmetry ticks; refit spot checks overlaid as markers).

Band-pad guard: mesh padding adds ψ=0 conduction/valence slots; with ε=0
they would alias into the LOW spectrum (ε_c,pad − ε_v ≈ −ε_v).  Pad
energies are pushed out of the window (ε_c,pad=+1e3 Ry, ε_v,pad=−1e3 Ry) —
pad transitions then sit at +2e3 Ry, harmless to the lowest n_eig.  (No-op
at 1×1 mesh: there are no pads.)

Run (never on a login node; module-free srun+shifter runner):
    python -m bse.exciton_bands -i cohsex.in --n-val 4 --n-cond 4 \
        --n-eig 6 --vq-mode both --refit-points 0,8,15,22,29
The input file must carry a K_POINTS crystal_b block (the Q path).

def _gather_host(x):
    """Gather a ``jax.Array`` to a full host numpy array, identical on every
    process, whether it is REPLICATED or PROCESS-SPANNING.

    ONE line of delegation to :func:`common.collectives.gather_to_host`, and
    the reasoning stays HERE because this driver is where it was learned:

    ``jax.device_get`` raises on an array whose shards live on OTHER processes
    (the diagnostic gate's Q-shifted ψ_c is μ-sharded ``P(...,'x')``, so on a
    16-process / 4-node run no single process holds it all) — those need
    ``multihost_utils.process_allgather``, which stitches the full logical
    array (gathering only the sharded axes) on every process.  But a
    FULLY-ADDRESSABLE array (replicated, or single-process) must NOT go through
    ``process_allgather(tiled=True)`` — that concatenates each process's full
    copy and DUPLICATES the leading axis (e.g. eps_c (144,·) → (16·144,·)).  So
    the service branches on ``is_fully_addressable``: ``device_get`` when the
    whole array is local, ``process_allgather`` only when shards are remote.
    The branch is a global property (identical on every process), so the
    collective stays in lockstep.  On one process everything is fully
    addressable ⇒ plain device_get.

    WHAT THIS DRIVER ACTUALLY FEEDS IT, NOW.  Only ``evs_dev`` — the
    block-Lanczos Ritz values, ``P()``-sharded.  The driver's own log line
    records that such an array reports ``fully_addressable=False`` at P=64
    (job 7882507), so it takes the service's ``is_fully_replicated`` arm: a
    LOCAL buffer read, no collective.  The one caller that used to hand this
    function a μ-sharded, genuinely process-spanning array — the on-grid
    diagnostic gate — no longer does; it contracts μ on device instead (see
    :func:`_gate_stats_on_device` for the three warm-up attempts that failed
    to make that gather work under impl=mpi).  So this driver now issues no
    cross-process host gather at all.

    The branch still matters and is still gated in
    ``tests/test_bse_gather_and_mesh.py``, because at 64 ranks the wrong arm
    silently returns an array 64× too long on the leading axis, and because
    the service is shared.

    WHY NOT ``gather_to_host``.  Three separate attempts to make a host gather
    work here failed on hardware at P=16 under
    ``JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION=mpi``, always in the same frame and
    always with "Communicator requested from a thread that is not the one MPI
    was initialized from": the mesh-clique warm-up did not cover it (job
    7882523), a ``process_allgather`` warm-up on a host operand did not (job
    7882531), and a path-exact warm-up on a genuinely sharded operand did not
    either (job 7882555/7882561).  ``multihost_utils.process_allgather``
    identity-jits to ``P()``, and at this point in the program that jit
    acquires a communicator from an intra-op pool worker; the warm-up
    mechanism that fixes ``shard_map(psum)`` cliques does not fix it.

    So stop trying to gather.  The μ contraction rides a mesh-AXIS psum, which
    IS warmed and works; everything else here is already replicated, so the
    host side needs no collective whatsoever.  This is also strictly cheaper:
    the old code pulled ``nk·nc·ns·n_μ`` complex numbers to every process
    inside a diagnostic, on the one axis the whole BSE is sharded over.

    Pad slots are exact zeros on both ψ legs, so the padded μ extent is
    carried through rather than sliced — slicing a sharded axis would be a
    reshard, and adding zeros changes neither a norm nor an inner product.
