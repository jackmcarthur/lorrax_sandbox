# psp/ — DFT Operator Module: Development Status

## What this module does

Constructs and applies the PW DFT Hamiltonian H = T + V_scf + V_NL entirely
on GPU via JAX.  Validated to 0.0000 mRy vs QE eigenvalues (Si 4×4×4 FR-PBE,
all 8 IBZ k-points).  Includes a working Davidson eigensolver that reads only
QE `.save/data-file-schema.xml` + `charge-density.hdf5` + pseudopotentials.

## File map

| `vnl_ops.py` | 444 | Dense VNL backend: table-lookup radial form factors, single Z matrix per k |
| `build_projectors_qe.py` | 908 | V_loc builder (FT of local PP), PP loading, projector splines |
| `solid_harmonics.py` | ~100 | Cartesian solid harmonics S_lm, autodiff-safe at K=0 |
| `archive/` | legacy | Archived CPU-heavy compatibility helpers (`build_projectors.py`, `projector_pipeline.py`) |

## 2026-04-13 migration update

- Active preprocessing callers now share the same VNL backend:
  `get_dipole_mtxels.py`, `get_dipole_mtxels_chunked.py`,
  `get_DFT_mtxels.py`, and `gw/kin_ion_io.py` now build one
  `vnl_ops.build_vnl_setup(...)` and then use per-k
  `build_vnl_kdata_from_kvec(...)` + dense JAX contractions.
- The custom JAX radial machinery remains centralized.  Uniform radial tables,
  custom interpolation/JVP handling, and the stable spherical-Bessel path all
  stay in `radial_jax.py` / `vnl_ops.py`; the caller scripts no longer carry a
  parallel CPU execution architecture.
- The old NumPy-heavy compatibility modules are archived under `psp/archive/`
  so the active tree is easier to read and trace.

## Bugs found and fixed (this session)

1. **truncation_2d=True hardcoded** in get_kin_ion and build_operator_setup.
   For 3D bulk: ~3 mRy band error, ~200 mRy offset. Now from sys_dim.
2. **kin_ion_io silently skipped V_loc** (checked `wfn.Vloc_r` which
   was never set). Any saved kin_ion.h5 from the chunked path was T-only.
3. **No validation pseudopotentials loaded**: silent T-only matrices.
4. **Davidson: standard eigh instead of generalized**. Non-orthogonal basis
   from preconditioned residuals requires Sc. Standard eigh gives zero modes.
5. **hamiltonian_matvec.py was 1120 lines of dead code** (imported by nobody).

## Performance (Si 4×4×4, 12 bands, nspinor=2, single A100)

### One-time costs
| Step | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| V_loc (numpy PP FT) | 0.5s | CPU; could be JIT'd |
| ρ_core NLCC (numpy Simpson) | 1.9s | CPU; biggest numpy bottleneck |
| V_H + V_xc (JIT trace) | 1.2s | `compute_V_H_and_V_xc`, cached at 1.2 ms |
| VNL setup (radial tables) | ~2s | CPU; q_max scan over k-points |
| Davidson JIT warmup | 6.8s | `warmup_jit()`: 4 _subspace_step + 2 apply_H shapes |

### Per k-point (warmed JIT)
| Step | Time |
|------|------|
| setup_H_k_from_kvec | ~20 ms |
| apply_H_k (H\|ψ⟩, 12 bands) | ~2 ms |
| _subspace_step (project+eigh+Ritz+precond) | ~1.4 ms |
| **Full Davidson (one k)** | **0.08–0.16s** |

### End-to-end NSCF
```
Setup:    7.2s (V_loc + NLCC + V_H/V_xc JIT + VNL)
Warmup:   6.8s (one-time JIT precompilation)
Davidson: 2.0s (8 k-points × ~0.25s amortized)
Write:    0.02s (WFN.h5)
Total:    26.2s
```

## How to test

### Eigenvalue validation (0.0 mRy target)

The canonical test is `tests/bench/test_dft_hamiltonian.py`.  It builds
H from a QE .save directory, diagonalizes in the NSCF wavefunction basis,
and compares eigenvalues at all IBZ k-points.  Self-contained, no stale
scripts.

```bash
# From anywhere with access to the Si data (e.g. Perlmutter):
SITE=$HOME/scratchperl/.isdf/isdf_venvs/isdf_site
LORRAX=/global/u2/j/jackm/software/lorrax_bse
SIDIR=/pscratch/sd/j/jackm/lorrax_sandbox_fresh/runs/Si/00_si_4x4x4_60band

cd $SIDIR
PYTHONPATH="$LORRAX/src:$SITE" \
JAX_ENABLE_X64=1 HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE \
XLA_PYTHON_CLIENT_PREALLOCATE=false \
python3 -u -m psp.tests.test_dft_hamiltonian \
    --save qe/scf/silicon.save \
    --pseudo_dir qe/scf \
    --wfn qe/nscf/WFN.h5

# Expected output: "PASS: all k-points match QE to < 0.01 mRy"
```

### Critical detail: k-point indexing

`load_kpoint_fftbox(ik)` treats `ik` as an UNFOLDED index (0..63), not an
IBZ index (0..7).  For k=0,1,2 these happen to coincide, but for k>=3
they diverge.  The test uses `read_Gvecs_to_devices` to load all 64
full-BZ wavefunctions, then indexes by `ibz_map[i_ibz]` → unfolded index.
This is the ONLY correct way to compare with WFN.h5 eigenvalues at k>=3.

Using `load_kpoint_fftbox(i_ibz)` directly gives ~1-5 mRy errors at k>=3
because wavefunctions and operators are at different k-points.

### Regression test (existing)
```bash
cd $LORRAX && uv run python -m pytest -q   # 13 tests, ~13s
```

## Key design decisions pressed in review

- **V_xc uses autodiff** (`jax.grad` through `pbe_xc`) rather than hand-coded
  functional derivatives.  This is correct for V_xc = d(ρε_xc)/dρ and the
  JIT'd version runs in 1.2 ms.  The autodiff trace is NOT needed for dipole
  matrix elements (those autodiff through V_NL, not V_xc).

- **Generalized eigh via Cholesky**, not scipy: `B + 1e-12·I → L → L⁻¹AL⁻ᵀ → eigh`.
  Keeps the entire _subspace_step on GPU in one JIT.  scipy_eigh was 0.2 ms
  but the CPU round-trip added ~3 ms/iter.

- **`at[].set()` always copies in JAX** — pre-allocated buffers don't help.
  We use `jnp.concatenate` for subspace expansion (XLA optimizes it well).

- **h_diag for preconditioner**: `|k+G|² + V_loc(G=0) + V_NL_diag(G)`.
  V_loc(G=0) = `mean(V_loc_r)`.  V_NL_diag = `Σ |Z(R,G)|² E(R,R)`.
  V_H(G=0)=0 and V_xc(G=0) not included — matches QE's g_psi.f90.

- **ngkmax padding**: all k-points padded to the same nG so one JIT serves all.
  Mask field on HamiltonianK zeros padding.  2% overhead for Si.

- **Fixed n_tgt block size**: converged bands get zero corrections, but keeping
  the block fixed avoids variable-shape recompilation in the Davidson loop.

## Remaining speedup opportunities

1. **ρ_core (1.9s)**: numpy Simpson's rule radial FT. Could be vectorized
   with JAX or precomputed as a lookup table (like vnl_ops does for VNL).
2. **V_loc (0.5s)**: numpy FT of local PP. Same opportunity as ρ_core.
3. **VNL setup**: WFN-based callers now skip the old host-side q_max scan by
   using `wfn.ecutwfc` in `vnl_ops.build_vnl_setup(...)`.  Remaining cost is
   the one-time radial-table build itself.
4. **JIT warmup (6.8s)**: XLA compilation of complex128 linalg kernels.
   Irreducible — only way to reduce is smaller m_max or float32.
5. **_subspace_step Cholesky (1.7 ms)**: dominates the 1.4 ms iteration.
   Could use `jnp.linalg.eigh` on the projected H directly if we
   orthonormalize the subspace (but that's what caused the original bug).

## QE → WFN.h5 pipeline status

### Working
- CrystalData reads structure, symmetries (48 ops + translations), FFT grid,
  ecutwfc/ecutrho, atoms, electronic params from data-file-schema.xml
- `build_kgrid(nk, nosym, noinv, no_t_rev, force_symmorphic)` generates
  IBZ matching QE's kpoint_grid.f90 algorithm
- `load_charge_density()` reads ρ_val from charge-density.hdf5
- Davidson produces eigenvalues (0.001 mRy accuracy) and eigenvectors
- `write_wfn_h5()` writes complete mf_header + wfns groups

### Known issues
- **Fractional translations**: 24/48 non-symmorphic translations have sign
  convention mismatch between QE XML and BGW WFN.h5 (pw2bgw uses different
  convention).  Rotation matrices match exactly.
- **IBZ representative choice** may differ from a specific QE run when
  `no_t_rev=True` is used (diamond inversion complicates TR handling).
- **_symmetrise_density in charge_density.py is broken** (increases density
  error 4.5×).  Not used in the current pipeline — we read QE's SCF density.
