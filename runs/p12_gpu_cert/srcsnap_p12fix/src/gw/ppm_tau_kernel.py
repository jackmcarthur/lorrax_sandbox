"""Device τ-kernel unit for the Σ_c(ω) GN-PPM integration.

The single-tau integrand kernel plus its cache/AOT machinery:

    σ^τ_nmk(τ) = project[ FFT[ G(τ) · W(τ) / √N_k ] ]
    G(τ)       = diag[ e^{-i(E_A - E_ref_A)·τ} ] · mask_A           (A = val or cond)
    W(τ)       = Σ_μν  B_q · e^{-i(Ω_q - E_ref_B)·τ}  · mask_B      (PPM pole sum)

This is the Σ_PPM file where SPMD / sharding / HLO expertise is required —
the deferred scan / collective-flush notes live here.  The projection tail
itself (the two-stage psum_scatter band reshard, its axis-order/stacking/
de-promotion levers and the gated MKL-GEMM FFI body) is SUBSUMED by the
shared primitive ``common.contract_bands.contract_bands_block_reshard``
(owner directive 2026-07-28) — this module keeps only the Σ-specific
channel algebra and the kernel plumbing around it.

The module-level kernel caches (`_sigma_tau_kernel_cache`,
`_sigma_kij_kernel_cache`) are co-located with the factories that read them.
This is load-bearing: ``precompile_sigma`` (the AOT prewarm called from
``ppm_pipeline``) must hit the *same* cache dicts as the runtime path, or the
first per-τ dispatch pays a full compile inside execution.

        the caller never pays a gather+broadcast pjit pair unpacking a
        sharded array (blocks on is_fully_addressable multi-process).
        merged_x=True: ONE complex X = ψ†σψ, (nk, m_X, n_Y) sharded, each
        mesh axis carrying ONE psum_scatter at HALF the stacked payload.

    CHANNEL PLANS — the Σ-OWNED algebra this wrapper adds to the primitive
    (owner ruling 2026-07-28; merge made the DEFAULT Laplace path by owner
    order the same day; derivation:
    wk_REL/DERIVATION_channel_hermiticity.md, manual §7.5):

    * ``merged_x=False`` → primitive ``channels="split_reim"``: σ^τ is
      split elementwise into σ_R = Re σ^τ, σ_I = Im σ^τ BEFORE projection
      and each real channel rides its own de-promoted GEMM chain,
      S_R = ψ†σ_Rψ, S_I = ψ†σ_Iψ.  REQUIRED for crossing (HGL core)
      windows: their host consumer (``_project_tau_onto_omega_np``,
      project_code=1) weights S_R and S_I with two INDEPENDENT real
      ω-vectors (Re(c)·S_I + Im(c)·S_R), and no per-slice symmetry can
      reconstruct the pair — the crossing phases enter σ^τ symmetrically
      under (μ,ν)→(ν,μ), so σ^τ is neither Hermitian nor
      complex-symmetric per slice; the only surviving relation
      σ^τ† = σ^{−τ} pairs different abscissae on a one-sided grid and
      buys nothing.  Nor is the pair recoverable from X = ψ†σψ: X
      carries 2n² real dof against the 4n² needed, and the
      Hermitian/anti-Hermitian split of X fails structurally (for
      Laplace windows both S_R and i·S_I are Hermitian → it returns
      (X, 0)).
    * ``merged_x=True`` → primitive ``channels="none"``: the single
      complex chain X = ψ†σψ = S_R + i·S_I — the path EVERY Laplace
      (project="full") window dispatches, licensed by BILINEARITY alone
      (their consumer forms only c·(S_R+i·S_I) = c·X); no symmetry
      assumption enters and crossing windows must NOT use it.  Half the
      GEMM work, half the collective payload, half the D2H bytes.
      NOT f64-split — genuinely complex × complex at minimal flops; the
      split was tried and REFUTED (job 7878942: Eigen dgemm ~172 GF/s is
      per-flop below its zgemm's 295; patch preserved at
      wk_REL/lgemm_full_2026-07-28.patch).  The BLAS-rate lever for BOTH
      plans is the primitive's LORRAX_BANDS_GEMM_FFI dial.
      Both plans coexist in every Σ run; no env flag selects between
      them.

    Same byte volume as the original pair of psums, but the output is
    sharded (m_X, n_Y) so every downstream coeff·σ multiply stays local —
    which is the whole point.  A downstream Σ_c(ω, k, m, n) accumulator
    that keeps this layout end-to-end holds a per-rank buffer of
    (n_b/p_x)·(n_b/p_y)·n_ω·n_k — ~100× smaller than a replicated Σ_μν,
    which is the scaling argument for shipping this layout end-to-end.

    Deferred follow-up if that on-GPU sharded accumulator is ever wired:
        (a) m-chunking at add-τ so σ^τ arrives one m-strip at a time rather
            than a full (m_full, n_Y/p) shard (default chunk = 1 tile = m/p);
            needed when (m, n, k, ω) per-rank stops fitting.
        (b) τ batching via lax.scan over a stacked τ axis — previously tried
            and reverted (regressed sigma_ppm ~80% at MoS2 3×3: multiple n_τ
            compiles, no amortization, lost async-dispatch overlap).  Re-add
            only when per-τ Python dispatch cost exceeds those costs.  (The
            primitive's ``extra`` stack axis is the natural carrier if it
            returns.)
        (c) collective-flush SlabIO variant (stage many τ on GPU, one
            parallel-HDF5 write at window close).

    Requires m % p_x == 0 and n % p_y == 0 — enforced by the primitive's
    actionable refusal (pad m and n INDEPENDENTLY via
    ``ppm_sigma.pad_sigma_window``; the exactly-zero pad block is dropped
    by ``ppm_sigma.strip_sigma_window`` before Σ leaves the branch).
