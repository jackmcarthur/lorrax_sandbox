"""GWJAX — the LORRAX GW driver.

``main()`` is the physics scaffold.  Each line below is one stage call
in this file, in execution order:

    quad            = build_static_quadrature(E_nk)        # minimax τ-axis, solved on

                                                           #   4-branch τ-integration]

    Σ_total         = solve_qp(Σ) | run_sc_driver(...)     # update_H per qp_solver      (qsgw_utils, sc_iteration)
    E_qp, U_qp      = eigh(kin_ion + Σ_total)              # + degenerate-set averaging  (degen_average)
    eqp0/eqp1/σ.dat = write_results(...)                   # writers, debug tables       (gw_output)

Two orthogonal config axes pivot the flow: ``compute_mode`` — the
self-energy ansatz (``x_only`` / ``cohsex`` / ``gn_ppm`` / ``hl_ppm``) —
and ``qp_solver`` — how QP energies are extracted from Σ
(``one_shot_dft`` / ``fixed_point`` / ``self_consistent``).  The
self-consistent path iterates the same ``compute_sigma_xc`` dispatch;
iteration 1 reproduces the one-shot result exactly (gated by
``tests/test_invariance_gates.py::test_sc_iteration1_equals_one_shot``).

Deliberate physics absences (do not "fix" these): G(τ) is never
materialized — it exists only as ψψ*-phases inside the χ₀/Σ kernels;
the q→0 Coulomb head is a scalar channel threaded through every stage,
not a stage; W is evaluated at exactly the two frequencies {0, iω_p} a
one-pole model is determined by.  See ``docs/theory/physics.md``.
