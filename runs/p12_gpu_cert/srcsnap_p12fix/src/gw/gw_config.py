"""Unified configuration for LORRAX GW calculations.

``LorraxConfig`` is built once via :meth:`LorraxConfig.from_input_file`
from the ``[cohsex]`` section of ``cohsex.in`` and threaded through the
entire driver.  Its ~80 input keys are grouped into sub-dataclasses
along the same axes the input file's section comments already use:

    config.head        — q→0 Coulomb-head sources & overrides
    config.minimax     — screening-minimax target error / max nodes / table mode
    config.ppm         — PPM model + sigma quadrature + on-shell σ_c options
    config.sigma_grid  — ω-grid for Σ_c(ω) output
    config.sc          — self-consistency loop knobs (qp_solver = self_consistent)
    config.memory      — chunk sizing
    config.backend     — FFI/IO backend selection (slab_io / gspace_io / w_dyson_solver)
    config.debug       — debug-only flags & file paths
    config.bse         — BSE interpolation setup (htransform-driven)
    config.paths       — output filenames

The top-level ``LorraxConfig`` retains only system geometry
(``nval`` / ``ncond`` / ``nband`` / ``sys_dim``) and the orthogonal
mode flags (``compute_mode`` / ``qp_solver`` / etc.) that the
driver reads on the fast path.

Derived sub-objects (the math-internal ``MinimaxConfig`` from
``minimax_config.py``, one instance per quadrature consumer) and derived
data (the Σ_c(ω) grid) are constructed on demand via ``LorraxConfig``
properties.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Environment grammar — ONE boolean vocabulary for the GW init/config layer
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# THIS IS THE CANONICAL COPY.  The tree still carries the same recognised
# token set in three other places, each with a reason:
#
#   * ``ffi/common/gate.py::MODE_SPELLINGS`` — three-valued (auto/off/on).
#     Its ``auto`` is load-bearing (a gate may DEMOTE and say so), so it is
#     deliberately NOT folded into a two-valued test; only its on/off halves
#     are the same vocabulary as ours.
#   * ``runtime.__init__._FALSY_TOKENS`` — the sanctioned two-valued
#     falsy-test resolver (the two-resolver doctrine,
#     docs/architecture/layers.md): ``runtime`` must resolve knobs BEFORE
#     jax/config imports are safe, so it keeps its own tiny parser.
#   * ``file_io/_slab_io_mpi_host.py::_env_flag`` — mirrors the C++
#     writer's ``env_flag`` (``ffi/cpp/phdf5/context.cc``) so the TWO
#     phdf5 writers stay one grammar; jax-free file, kept local.
#
# ``isdf/core.py``'s ``_env_bool`` — historically the fourth copy — was
# retired by the P1.3 unification (2026-07-31): ``isdf.core`` now imports
# :func:`env_bool` from here (L1→L1; ``gw/__init__`` pulls only this
# jax-free module, so the import adds nothing and cannot cycle).  The
# remaining copies are pinned set-equal by
# ``tests/test_env_grammar.py::test_defect3_vocabulary_has_not_drifted``,
# which reads them straight out of the source text, without importing jax,
# and fails on any drift.
#
# SEMANTICS:
#   unset or blank      -> the caller's default
#   a truthy spelling   -> True        (case- and whitespace-insensitive)
#   a falsy spelling    -> False
#   anything else       -> False, AND announced once (see ``env_bool``)
#
# Resolving an unrecognised token to something other than False would
# split the grammar between converted and unconverted readers of the same
# knob; adding telemetry does not.

    * ``bool(os.environ.get(...))`` — same presence-test class.

    ``import mpi4py`` alone proves nothing: the package import succeeds
    on a broken PMI stack and the run then dies at the first SlabIO open
    with ``MPI_Init_thread() failed [error code: 16]`` (a PMI flavour
    mismatch between the launcher and the MPI library).  So the probe
    does the real thing — ``from mpi4py import MPI`` — which runs
    ``MPI_Init_thread``.  The init cost is not wasted: the selected
    backend needed it anyway (same rationale as ``phdf5_init_mpi`` in
    ``gw_jax.configure_run``).

    Never raises: an init failure is a *probe* result, not a run killer
    — the router demotes and says why.  An explicit
    ``slab_io=phdf5_host`` request bypasses this probe and keeps
    fails-loudly semantics at the first SlabIO open.

    BEFORE the in-process ``MPI_Init_thread``: on a bare launch (no PMI
    environment) that init does not fail catchably — Intel MPI aborts the
    whole process inside ``MPIR_pmi_init`` (job 7884926), which would turn
    this probe into the crash it exists to prevent.  So a PMI-less launch
    first proves singleton init in a throwaway subprocess and demotes when
    the child dies.

    as an explicit override, see ``from_input_file``).  Three tiers,
    best first — each one loud about why it was or was not taken,
    because "which writer ran" is the single most consequential thing
    about a large run's memory profile:

    1. ``PHDF5_FFI`` — the host FFI lib exports the collective write
       handler.  Zero extra Python environment; the ζ tile never leaves
       the rank that owns it.
    2. ``PHDF5_HOST`` — no write handler in the lib, but the interpreter
       has ``mpi4py`` + an ``HDF5_MPI=ON`` h5py (the AB overlay) and
       MPI actually initializes (the probe runs ``MPI_Init_thread``, so
       a PMI-mismatched harness demotes here instead of dying later).
       Same MPI-IO semantics, extra env.
    3. ``H5PY_ALLGATHER`` — neither; rank-0 serial write behind a full
       ``process_allgather`` of the tensor.

    The tier-1 probe is :func:`ffi_loader.probe_target`, not a bare
    ``has_target``: its three-state reason distinguishes "lib not built
    with the handler" (rebuild) from "lib could not be loaded"
    (``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``) — a distinction that cost workstream P a day.
    Never raises: any probe failure demotes to the next tier.

    Handler presence alone is NOT capability: both MPI tiers call
    ``MPI_Init_thread``, and on a bare launch with no PMI environment
    Intel MPI aborts the process inside ``MPIR_pmi_init`` instead of
    returning an error (job 7884926 — the fastloop's bare P=1 gw stage
    died at the first collective H5Fcreate).  So tier 1 additionally
    requires :func:`_probe_mpi_bootstrap_ffi` (launcher PMI environment,
    else a subprocess singleton-init probe) and demotes with an
    announcement when MPI cannot bootstrap — the same degrade-and-say-why
    contract as the GPU router's multi-node FFI demotion.  An explicit
