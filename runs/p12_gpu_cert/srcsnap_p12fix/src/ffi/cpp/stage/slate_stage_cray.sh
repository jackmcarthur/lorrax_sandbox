# stage_cray.sh — populate a staging dir (default $HOME/software, see
# LORRAX_FFI_SLATE_DIR below) with copies of the Cray runtime libs that
# SLATE's Cray-built .so's NEED but aren't in nvcr.io/nvidia/jax.
#
# Why:
#   SLATE is built against the host Cray PE (CC=cc CXX=CC FC=ftn) so it can
#   use libsci for optimal BLAS/LAPACK and GPU-aware MPI via libmpi_gtl_cuda.
#   Inside the Shifter container those libs live under /opt/cray, which
#   Shifter forbids as a --volume source (NERSC siteFs allows /pscratch
#   /global/* /dvs_* but not /opt).  The fix is the same as phdf5's
#   stage_cray.sh: copy the libs once into $HOME/software (off purged
#   $SCRATCH) and bind-mount at runtime.
#
# Run on a login node with the needed modules loaded:
#
#   module load cray-libsci cray-mpich cray-pmi
#   src/ffi/cpp/stage/slate_stage_cray.sh
#
# Then use with `LORRAX_SLATE_STACK=cray` in run_shifter.sh (bind-mounted
# at /lorrax_slate inside the container).

# that'd dangle when lifted out of /opt/cray/pe/.
#
# libdarshan.so.0 lives under /global/common (already in shifter siteFs) so
# isn't staged here; we just add that path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH at runtime.
