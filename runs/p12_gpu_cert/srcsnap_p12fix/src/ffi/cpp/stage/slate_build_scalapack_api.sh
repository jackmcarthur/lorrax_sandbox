# build_scalapack_api.sh — build SLATE's OPTIONAL ScaLAPACK-compatibility
# overlay, `libslate_scalapack_api.so`, from a SLATE source tree.
#

#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS, AND WHY THE THING IT BUILDS IS NOT A LORRAX
# DEPENDENCY.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# It is the RED TWIN for the provenance guard in
# src/ffi/cpp/scalapack/blacs_grid.h.  That guard refuses to run LORRAX's
# ScaLAPACK handlers when their pXheevd / pXgetrf have been interposed by
# SLATE's overlay; a guard whose failing case cannot be produced is void
# (wk_REL/README.md §5 lesson 1), and this script produces it.
#
# It is ALSO the measurement behind PORTING.md §0's "SLATE's own optional
# libslate_scalapack_api" row.  Run `nm -D` on the artifact and you get, for
# LORRAX's eleven ScaLAPACK/BLACS names (SLATE v2025.05.28, measured
# 2026-07-31):
#
#     DEFINED (6)  pzheevd_ pdsyevd_ pzgetrf_ pdgetrf_ pzgetrs_ pdgetrs_
#     UNDEF   (2)  numroc_ Cblacs_gridinfo          <- the overlay CALLS these
#     absent  (3)  descinit_ Csys2blacs_handle Cblacs_gridinit
#
# i.e. the overlay covers 100% of the OPERATIONS LORRAX asks ScaLAPACK to
# perform and 0% of the grid/descriptor infrastructure — it is a layer ON TOP
# of a real ScaLAPACK+BLACS (upstream's own link line is
# `-lslate_scalapack_api -lslate -lmkl_scalapack_lp64 ...`), never a
# replacement for one.  Do NOT put it in LORRAX_SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES as if it
# were a provider: see the three defects listed in blacs_grid.h.
#
# UPSTREAM DOES NOT BUILD THIS TARGET FROM CMAKE.  SLATE v2025.05.28's
# CMakeLists.txt has the whole `scalapack_api` block COMMENTED OUT with
# `# todo: requires ScaLAPACK` (lines 228-244) — so it is absent from a
# CMake install regardless of what -DSCALAPACK_LIBRARIES is set to.  Only the
# GNUmakefile route builds it, and that route wants a full autoconf-style
# `make config`.  This script therefore compiles the same source list the
# GNUmakefile declares (scalapack_api_src, which excludes `getri` —
# upstream: "todo: getri not finished") directly against an existing SLATE
# install, which is the cheap and reproducible way to get the artifact.
