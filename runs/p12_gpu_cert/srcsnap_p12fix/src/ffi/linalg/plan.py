"""Resolved linalg PLANS — resolve once, then just call.

A :class:`LinalgPlan` is the answer to "what will this op actually run,
where does its input have to live, and where does its output come out?",
computed ONCE:

    plan = linalg.plan("eigh", mesh_xy, backend=cfg.eigh_backend, n=rank)
    if plan.is_native:
        lam, R = jnp.linalg.eigh(A_batch)      # caller owns the fast path
    else:
        lam, R = plan(A_tile)                  # or plan.batched(A_stack)

Why this exists
---------------
Every FFI-linalg call site in the tree grew the same five lines around
the one that matters: ``resolve_backend(...)`` → compare against
``NATIVE`` → build a ``NamedSharding(mesh, P('x','y'))`` → ``device_put``
/ ``with_sharding_constraint`` the operand into it → loop the batch axis
and ``jnp.stack`` the results because this particular backend has no
batched entry point.  Five copies of that is five places for the
FFI-adjacent resharding to drift, and resharding around an FFI call is
exactly where this code base has lost the most time (scorecard J.9's
silent NaNs, T.4's per-call recompile, V.4's deleted ``_reshard_z``).

So the plan owns them.  ``plan.in_sharding`` is the contract, written
down instead of re-derived; ``plan(A)`` puts ``A`` there before calling;
``plan.batched(A)`` is the SAME call for every backend whether or not
the library underneath happens to have a batched entry point.

What it deliberately does NOT do
--------------------------------
* **It does not change resolution.**  :func:`plan` calls
  :func:`ffi.linalg.resolve.resolve_backend` with the caller's arguments
  and stores the answer.  Route strings, ``auto`` policy and every guard
  are byte-identical to calling the resolver directly — the pinned route
  tests cover both spellings.
* **It does not own the native implementations.**  ``native`` is a real
  backend (``jnp.linalg.eigh``; the replicated/sharded Cholesky and per-q
  LU in ``isdf/core``) whose fast paths are batched, fused into the
  caller's jit, and in the Cholesky/LU case not expressible as a single
  call at all.  ``plan.is_native`` says "you own this one" and
  ``plan(...)`` raises rather than pretending; the one exception is
  ``eigh``, where the native path IS one call and the plan runs it, so
  that ``dispatch_eigh``'s uniform behaviour is preserved exactly.

Layout contract (the same for all three ops, and the reason one class
covers them): the FFI backends take **one tile spread over the whole
mesh**, ``P('x','y')``, and return their matrix-shaped outputs in that
same layout.  Stacked/batched forms carry a leading, unsharded batch
axis: ``P(None,'x','y')``.  Vector-shaped outputs (eigenvalues) are
REPLICATED.
