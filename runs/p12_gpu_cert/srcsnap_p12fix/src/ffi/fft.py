"""Flat-k batched 3-D FFT — the ``LORRAX_FFT_FFI`` / ``LORRAX_FFT_FFI_FUSED``
service.

The Python half of the flat-k FFT handlers.  ONE set of ``ffi_call`` sites
serves BOTH platforms, because the two libraries deliberately register the
SAME target strings under different C++ symbols
(``ffi_loader.py:99-107`` CUDA vs ``:140-142`` host — the phdf5
same-target/different-symbol split):

    cpu   liblorrax_ffi_host.so   MKL FFT via the DFTI *descriptor* API
                                  (``src/ffi/cpp/mklfft/fft_flat_k_ffi.cc``) —
                                  a genuine O(N log N) FFT at any k-count;
                                  NOT a DFT-as-matmul (owner-vetoed).
    CUDA  liblorrax_ffi.so        cuFFT with the ADVANCED DATA LAYOUT
                                  (``src/ffi/cpp/cufft/fft_flat_k_cuda_ffi.cc``):
                                  ``cufftPlanMany64`` inembed/istride=T/idist=1,
                                  the exact stride-descriptor analog; an
                                  NVRTC-compiled kernel fuses the G·W
                                  multiply + norms.

That is why ``src/ffi/cufft/`` has no Python module of its own — see its
``__init__.py``.  Full contract: ``docs/dev/flat_k_fft_service.md``.

WHY the service exists: XLA:CPU's ``fft`` custom-call requires the
transformed axes minor-most, so every ``dot`` (k-major flat) ↔ ``fft``
(k-minor 3-D) boundary in the Σ τ kernel pays a full transpose copy of the
~398 MB/rank μ² tile — measured 60-65% of ``sigma.exec`` at nb=128/P=64 and
CLOSED as structural for any XLA-side arrangement
(``wk_REL/sigma_perf_results.md``).  Stride descriptors read the dot-layout
tile where it lies, so the transposes disappear instead of moving.

Two entry LAYERS, and the gate reaches only one — stated because it is
structural, not a TODO.  ``make_flat_k_*`` wraps its own ``shard_map`` and
is FFI-gated; ``fft_helpers.local_fftn3``/``local_ifftn3`` are bare
``jnp.fft`` aliases for code ALREADY inside a ``shard_map`` (which cannot
nest) and have no FFI route at all.  ``isdf/core.py`` and
``common/wfn_transforms.py`` call the second layer, so ``LORRAX_FFT_FFI``
structurally cannot reach them.

ADOPTION STATE (2026-07-30; superseded 2026-07-31): this module IS the
single implementation.  ``common/fft_helpers.py`` delegated — it imports
the gate and both wrapper bodies from here (``fft_helpers.py:304``) and
carries no copy of its own.  The equivalence pin ``wk_REL/gatecheck.py``
(cells A2/E/E2) now guards the re-export seam rather than a second copy.
