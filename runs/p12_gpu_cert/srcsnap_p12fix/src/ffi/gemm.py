"""Vendor-BLAS batched GEMM — the ``LORRAX_BANDS_GEMM_FFI`` service.

The Python half of ``src/ffi/cpp/mklblas/gemm_batch_ffi.cc``: the gate that
decides whether the dial is on, and the single ``jax.ffi.ffi_call`` that
issues the handler.  Per ``src/ffi/AGENTS.md:149-150`` and
``TEMPLATE.md:10-20`` this is where an FFI target's Python lives; it used to
live in ``common/contract_bands.py``, which is a *physics* module.

Scope, stated up front so nobody "adopts" this everywhere: this is NOT a
general GEMM service.  It is the body of ONE contraction — the large right
contraction of ``common.contract_bands.contract_bands_block_reshard`` — and
nothing else in the tree is routed through it.  Full contract:
``docs/dev/vendor_gemm_service.md``.

    C[i] = A[i] @ B[i % BB]      A (BA, M, K), B (BB, K, N), BA % BB == 0

row-major NN, dtype dispatched inside the ``.so`` from the buffer element
type onto ``cblas_{d,s,z,c}gemm[_batch]`` (all four BLAS precisions since
2026-07-29).  No ``input_output_aliases``: a ``(BA, M, N)`` output can never
legally alias a ``(BA, M, K)``/``(BB, K, N)`` operand buffer — contrast the
shape-preserving mklfft handlers, which do alias.

Host platform ONLY.  ``lorrax_mklblas_gemm_batch`` is in ``ffi_loader``'s
host table and not the CUDA one (``ffi_loader.py:146`` vs ``:92-116``), so a
forced CUDA probe reports *unknown target*; XLA:GPU's own ``dot`` lowering
already dispatches cuBLAS and is deliberately untouched.

#: The ``LORRAX_BANDS_GEMM_FFI`` dial.  Default ON — the FFI layer is
#: REQUIRED (owner ruling, ``docs/architecture/decisions.md`` 2026-08-01):
#: on a CPU mesh a missing handler is a startup refusal naming the ``.so``
#: (``Gate.enforce``), never a demotion.  The pre-ruling ``auto`` mode
#: (capability detection, owner order 2026-07-29) was deleted with the
#: ruling — auto-demotion to the XLA duplicate is exactly what it forbids.
#:
#: ``=0`` is a real, announced debug opt-out (off_policy="fallback"): the
#: XLA einsum arm in ``common.contract_bands`` is RETAINED — not as a
#: duplicate, but because the ``extra='minor'`` operand order structurally
#: cannot ride a batched GEMM, so the native arm must exist regardless.
#:
#: ``silent_platform_demote`` is the one place this gate is allowed to keep
#: quiet, and the reason is recorded in the field itself: on a GPU run the
#: dial is not merely off, it does not exist (host symbol table only) and
#: XLA:GPU's dot lowering already dispatches cuBLAS — the required path on
#: that platform IS the native lowering.
