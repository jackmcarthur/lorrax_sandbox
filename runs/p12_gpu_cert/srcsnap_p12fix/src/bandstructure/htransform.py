    """Solve psi_mu @ Q = psi_r using a Galerkin projection (spin folded into μ).

    DEAD CODE as of 2026-07-30 — a repo-wide search finds no caller, no test
    and no driver that reaches this function; ``streaming_galerkin_solve`` is
    what the four live consumers use.  It is annotated rather than deleted
    because deletion is an owner call, but DO NOT resurrect it without fixing
    two things first, neither of which is covered by any gate:

    1.  ``G + 1e-11 * I`` below is an ABSOLUTE ridge.  Every other ridge in
        LORRAX is relative to the operator's own scale — ``factor_c_q`` uses
        ``1e-14·|trace|``, ``h_transform``'s S-Cholesky uses
        ``1e-10·mean(diag)``, ``zeta_ridge`` uses ``ε·|tr|/n`` — because an
        absolute constant is meaningless once the units or the system size
        change.  On a small-trace G it dominates; on a large-trace G it does
        nothing.
    2.  It truncates twice and inconsistently: once with the mask
        ``s > s.max()*rtol`` and again inside ``lstsq(rcond=rtol)``, which
        applies its own relative cut to the ALREADY-truncated ``coeffs``.
        The composite amplification cap is therefore not ``1/rtol`` and is
        not stated anywhere.  ``common/rank_criterion`` is the one place the
        cap should be expressed.

    ``streaming_galerkin_solve`` has neither problem: one truncation, one
    stated cap, and a Cholesky on a G whose only regularisation is the exact
    identity block on the null pad.
