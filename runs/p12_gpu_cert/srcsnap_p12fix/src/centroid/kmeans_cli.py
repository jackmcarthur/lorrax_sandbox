"""CLI driver for the weighted k-means ISDF point selector.

Run as ``python3 -m centroid.kmeans_cli N_C [opts]``.

The physics, in the order it happens: pick the density that decides WHERE
the ISDF quadrature gets points; run a density-weighted k-means over the
real-space FFT grid, optionally in orbit representatives so the answer is
closed under the crystal point group; snap to the grid and unfold; then
prune the over-sampled candidate pool down to N_c by pivoted Cholesky on
the pair-density Gram, which keeps the points that span the band window
Σ actually consumes.

Device meshes, sharding and placement live in :mod:`centroid.distribution`.

def _resolve_sigma_window(args, wfn) -> tuple[int, int]:
    """``(n_val, n_cond)`` of the σ window — the bands the ISDF must span.

    Single source of truth for both consumers: the pivoted-Cholesky prune
    band ranges and the ``band_range`` k-means weight.

    KEEP THESE TWO EXPLICIT.  ``n_cond`` defaulting to ``n_val`` gave every
    centroid set built before 2026-07-29 a prune window of (0, n_val) ×
    (0, 2·n_val) while Σ_c consumed the full band square: at nb=1024 the
    selection came back rank-deficient by 30 % (897 orbits requested, 630
    achieved, Gram diagonals at 7.6e-17) and the QP gap went NEGATIVE.
    Dose-response is monotone in the window: (0,52) → eqp0 0.3645,
    (0,256) → 3.1350, (0,1024) → 3.7227.  ``wk_REL/centroid_rank_gate.sh``
    reads this run's log and FAILS on the shortfall — do not reword the
    "target N orbits", "prune window:" or "After pruning ... rank=N" lines
    below without updating it.

    BUG FIX 2026-07-29 (size campaign, ladder notes R12).  The default was

        n_cond = min(n_val, nb_total - n_val)

    which CLAMPS the conduction extent to ``n_val`` and therefore has nothing
    to do with the window Σ_c actually consumes.  On the MoS2 4×4 deck
    (``nelec = 26``) it produced a 26×52 prune window for EVERY centroid set
    the size campaign built — b256 c2500, b512 c7000, b1024 c10000, b1024
    c15000 — while the b1024 deck's σ window is ``nval 26 + ncond 998 = 1024``.
    The ISDF basis was thus selected to resolve a 26×52 pair-density block and
    then used for a 1024×1024 one.  Measured cost of the clamp at
    (nb=1024, N=10000, M=13872), same WFN and same candidate pool:

        prune window (0,52)   -> Gram diag min 7.632e-17, rank 630 / 897
        prune window (0,256)  -> Gram diag min 7.189e-13, rank 897 / 897
        prune window (0,1024) -> Gram diag min 4.996e-12, rank 897 / 897

    i.e. the old default was **rank-deficient by 30%**: pivoted Cholesky was
    asked for 897 independent directions and could only certify 630, because
    the narrow window leaves most candidate centroids at numerically-zero Gram
    diagonal.  This is treated as a BUG, not a default change — every
    pre-fix centroid set is affected and should be regarded as selected for a
    different, much smaller problem than the one it was used on.

    The new default is the FULL conduction window present in the WFN, which is
    a superset of any deck's ncond and therefore always safe.  Narrowing is
    still available explicitly via ``--prune-n-cond``.  Cost of the fix is
    small and was measured, not assumed: the (0,1024) build took 349 s against
    308 s for (0,52) at nb=1024 — +13% wall, +15 GB peak (81 GB of 186 GB).
