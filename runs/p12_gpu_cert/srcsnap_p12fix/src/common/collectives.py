"""THE cross-process layer: one wrapped API for everything that spans ranks.

A driver that needs another process's data — or needs to agree with it —
calls this module and nothing below it.  Nothing here requires the caller to
know what a ``Mesh``, a ``NamedSharding``, a ``shard_map`` or
``multihost_utils`` is; that is the point.  Every function imports jax
*inside its body*, so importing this module costs nothing and is safe before
``jax.distributed.initialize``.

In the order a driver meets it: **topology** (:func:`process_rank_world`,
:func:`device_count`); **the mesh and its warm-up** (:func:`prepare_mesh`,
:func:`resolve_mesh`, :func:`single_device_mesh`); **staging onto a mesh
without a collective** (:func:`device_put_process_local`,
:func:`replicate_to_mesh`, :func:`shard_over_k`); **reductions and gathers**
(:func:`psum_replicate`, :func:`all_gather_processes`,
:func:`gather_to_host`, :func:`gather_indexed_blocks`,
:func:`psum_scatter_checked`); **the k-partitioned sweep**
(:func:`local_share`, :func:`sweep_local_k`, :func:`gather_k_blocks`); and
**barriers** (:func:`barrier`, :func:`warm_mesh_cliques`).

Two of these are the ones a physics driver actually wants:
:func:`prepare_mesh` (*"give me the run's mesh, with every communicator it
will need already created"*) and :func:`gather_k_blocks` (*"run this per-k
block on every k and hand me all of them"*), with the partition, the
pipelining, the warm-up and the gather inside.

Two pairs here look interchangeable and are not — read their docstrings
before choosing.  :func:`all_gather_processes` vs :func:`gather_to_host`
(different-value-per-process vs one-global-array; the wrong branch silently
multiplies the leading axis by P), and ``warm_mesh_cliques`` vs
``runtime.nccl_warmup`` (only :func:`prepare_mesh`'s CALL SITE unifies them;
their bodies must stay separate).

Why the barrier is the module's founding member
-----------------------------------------------
The codebase had seven copies of this shape, wrapped around the barrier
that follows a rank-0-only HDF5 write::

    try:
        from jax.experimental import multihost_utils as _mh
        _mh.sync_global_devices("restart_head_scalars")
    except Exception:
        pass

The intent was benign — "don't blow up in a single-process run" — but the
handler catches far more than that.  ``sync_global_devices`` raises when
the distributed client is *broken*: a peer has died, a timeout expired, a
rank reached a barrier its peers never will.  Swallowing that is the worst
possible response, because the surviving rank then sails past a barrier
its peers are still blocked in.  The result is the campaign's signature
failure: the job hangs or half-completes, srun reaps it, and the exit code
at the sbatch level is **0**.

The correct split is:

* **single process** → the barrier is genuinely a no-op; skip it, silently.
* **``multihost_utils`` unavailable** → ditto (there is nothing to sync).
* **anything else** → fatal.  Let it propagate so the rank dies loudly and
  takes the job's exit code with it.

That is what :func:`barrier` implements, and it is the *only* thing it
does differently from the code it replaces.

The module's second job — :func:`device_put_process_local` — is the
mirror image: a cross-process placement that must NOT become a
collective.  See its docstring for the JAX behaviour it works around.

    square REFUSES here, naming the square counts to request.  The ruling's
    stated safety net — build s x s and idle the surplus ranks — is
    deliberately NOT implemented on this stack, because idle ranks cannot be
    made deadlock-free without deep surgery: (a) under the production
    transport ``JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION=mpi``, communicator
    creation is ``MPI_Comm_split`` — collective over ``MPI_COMM_WORLD`` (see

    the BSE TDA Lanczos outright (32 refusals at P=16, gate 7881216).  A

    * :func:`warm_mesh_cliques` (CPU/MPI) is correct *because* its jit is
      small enough that XLA takes ``ThunkExecutor::ExecuteSequential`` and
      runs the thunk inline on the calling thread — that inlining IS the
      mechanism, not an implementation detail.
    * ``runtime.nccl_warmup`` (GPU/NCCL) deliberately routes through
      ``jax.jit(jnp.sum)`` on a sharded array, because ``lax.psum`` is not
      callable from a top-level jit, and its purpose is to force
      ``ncclCommInitRank`` topology discovery, which has no thread constraint.

    A merged body would have to satisfy both, and the CPU constraint bounds
    program size in a way the GPU one does not need.

    Both are no-ops off their platform, at P=1, and on an already-warmed mesh,

      process-local value; stack or concatenate them.
    * this one — there is a single logical array, and the question is only
      whether this process happens to hold all of it.

    Getting that branch wrong is SILENT.  ``jax.device_get`` raises on an
    array whose shards live on other processes, so that direction is loud.
    The other direction is not: ``process_allgather(tiled=True)`` on a
    FULLY-ADDRESSABLE (replicated, or single-process) array concatenates each
    process's complete copy and MULTIPLIES THE LEADING AXIS BY P — e.g.
    ``eps_c (144, ·) → (2304, ·)`` at P=16, a plausible array of the wrong
    shape (``bse/exciton_bands.py:117-119`` documents having been bitten).

    ``is_fully_addressable`` is a GLOBAL property — identical on every
    process — so the branch keeps the collective in lockstep.  Five wrapper
    functions in this tree hand-roll this, four of them naming another in
    their own docstring, and they disagree on ``tiled``; this is the one they
    should call.

    THREE ARMS, NOT TWO — and the middle one is the whole point.
    ``is_fully_replicated`` and ``is_fully_addressable`` are DIFFERENT
    predicates and a two-arm version gets replicated arrays wrong.  jax's own
    ``Array`` docstring says it: *"fully replicated is not equal to fully
    addressable; a fully replicated array can span multiple hosts."*  A
    ``P()``-sharded array at P=64 has 64 devices in its sharding and 1
    addressable, so ``is_fully_addressable`` is **False** — measured, in this
    tree, by ``bse/exciton_bands.py``'s own log line:

        [dist] evs sharding=NamedSharding(mesh=Mesh('x': 8, 'y': 8),
               spec=P(), ...), fully_addressable=False        (job 7882507)

    A two-arm version therefore pushed every replicated array through a
    collective it does not need.  That is wasted communication at best, and at
    worst a refusal: under ``JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION=mpi`` it took
    down the ``exciton_bands`` on-grid gate on every cell of jobs 7882523,
    7882531 and 7882555 at P=16 with "Communicator requested from a thread
    that is not the one MPI was initialized from".

    When the array is fully replicated, this process ALREADY holds all of it:
    read shard 0 locally and issue nothing.  ``file_io._slab_io_allgather``
    has carried this arm and its rationale all along
    (``PROCESS_ALLGATHER_DESIGN_REVIEW_2026-05-20.md``); the service did not,
    which is why it was the least correct of the five wrappers it was meant to

    collected lazily and copied to the host in a single transfer at the end,
    so a sweep over ``n`` local k costs ONE device→host copy instead of ``n``
    blocking ones.  Returns ``(vals, idx)`` in exactly the layout
    :func:`gather_indexed_blocks` consumes: ``vals`` is ``(blk, *item_shape)``
    with unused rows zero, ``idx`` is ``(blk,)`` with ``-1`` in the unused
    slots.

    ``item_shape`` is REQUIRED rather than inferred from the first block
    because a rank can legitimately draw NO k: ``world > nk`` (P=64 on a 16-k
    deck) leaves ``world - nk`` ranks with an empty list, and the gather is a
    collective — every rank must contribute the same shape or it
    mis-assembles.  An empty rank has no block to infer from.

    WHY THE PER-K READBACK WAS THE COST, not the transfer volume.  Each
    ``np.asarray(H_k)`` is a full host synchronisation: it drains the device
    queue, so the *next* k's ψ read (h5py, host-side, hundreds of ms) could
    not start until the *current* k's FFTs had finished.  The two are
    independent — a k block of ⟨mk|O|nk⟩ touches no other k — and deferring
    the copy lets them overlap.  This is only legal once every k presents the
    SAME operand shapes; with a ragged ``ngk`` each k was a distinct XLA
    executable and the loop was a sequence of unrelated dispatches (owner
    decision D10).

    ``lookahead`` bounds how far the host may run ahead of the device.  It
    matters because the operand being held in flight is the ψ FFT box —
    ``nb·nspinor·nx·ny·nz·16`` B, 189 MB at MoS₂ 4×4/256 bands — and an
    unbounded queue would hold one per pending k.  ``2`` is the smallest value
    that still overlaps read *k+1* with compute *k*; it caps the extra
    residency at one box.  Note ``block_until_ready`` is a synchronisation,
    NOT a transfer, so the one-readback contract holds for any lookahead.

# The checked reduce-scatter
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY
# ---
# ``jax.lax.psum_scatter`` under ``JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION=gloo``
# silently returns wrong data in ~5 % of executions — always output segment 0,
# always a plausible magnitude, always with a zero exit code
# (``wk_REL/UPSTREAM_gloo_psum_scatter_corruption.md``).  The transport verdict
# is that mpi is clean in 584/584, so this is not a live fire; it is the
# durable answer to "what makes the NEXT one detectable".  There are fifteen
# reduce-scatter sites in this codebase and none of them carries an invariant.
# This function is the ONE place that changes for all fifteen — no per-call-site
# carve-outs, one primitive, one tolerance, one message.
#
# THE CHECK — Freivalds, not a plain sum
# --------------------------------------
# A reduce-scatter over a replica group of P ranks satisfies, by definition,
#
#     concat_r out_r  ==  sum_p x_p
#
# so for ANY weight tensor ``w`` the two weighted sums must agree:
#
#     sum_{global j} w_j (sum_p x_p)_j  ==  sum_r sum_{local j} w_{rL+j} out_r[j]
#
# A PLAIN sum would not do: it is invariant under moving mass between segments,
# and it cancels for a zero-mean perturbation — which is exactly the observed
# failure shape (a stale / dropped / duplicated SEGMENT, §4.6a).  With an
# incoherent ``w``, a corrupted segment escapes only on a measure-zero
# coincidence.
#
# Both sides are built from ``psum``, which the corruption study established as
# the clean path: the all-reduce-only formulation of the same reduction was
# 200/200 clean in the same harness that corrupted the reduce-scatter.  The
# checker therefore does not rest on the primitive it is checking.
#
# ``w`` must NOT be materialised — it would be as large as the payload (253 MB
# at the corrupting shape) — so it is RANK-1 FACTORISED,
# ``w[i0,i1,…] = prod_d v_d[i_d]``.  The contraction is then a sequence of
# axis-wise matrix-vector products: ONE pass over the operand, O(1) extra
# memory, and no large intermediate (the "no replicated large intermediates"
# rule is respected by construction).
#
# The two checksums ride ONE scalar all-reduce, not two: only
# ``|psum(s_in − s_out)|`` is needed, so the difference is formed locally and a
# single 2-element ``psum`` carries it together with the scale.
#
# COST — measured, wk_REL/collective_invariants_notes.md §2.3.  In the form
# below (two contractions, no separate scale pass) it is +0.7 % on the 0.41 MB
# BSE collective under mpi and +1.3 % under gloo — free at the payload BSE
# actually issues.  It is NOT free at Sigma-class payloads: +107 % at 41 MB and
# +56 % at 253 MB under mpi, because the contraction is a memory-bandwidth
# sweep over the operand while the mpi reduce-scatter of the same operand is
# fast.  Under gloo everything is under +5 %.  Read §2.3-2.4 before wiring it
# anywhere; §2.4 prices the sub-sampling lever that brings the large payloads
# down.
#
# WIRING STATUS: no call site uses this yet.  Ten of the fifteen reduce-scatter
# sites live in ``contract_bands.py`` and ``zeta_projection.py``, which the
# all-MPI migration workstream owns.  Wiring is an owner decision on the
# measured cost, and it should land as ONE change across all fifteen.

def warm_mesh_cliques(mesh, *, print_fn=print) -> float:
    """Create every mesh-axis MPI communicator on the calling (main) thread.

    THE PROBLEM.  jaxlib 0.9.1's
    ``xla::cpu::MpiCollectives::CreateCommunicators`` refuses with ``MPI:
    Communicator requested from a thread that is not the one MPI was
    initialized from`` unless ``MPI_Is_thread_main`` is true, and XLA:CPU's
    PARALLEL ``ThunkExecutor`` issues collective thunks from intra-op pool
    workers.  So under ``JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION=mpi`` any clique
    whose FIRST use is inside a real jitted program dies on every rank.  This
    is what killed the BSE TDA Lanczos (job 7879458).

    THE MECHANISM THAT FIXES IT.  The guard fires only on communicator
    CREATION, and ``xla::cpu::AcquireCommunicator`` caches communicators in a
    process-global clique map keyed *only* by the participating-device set:
    it takes the map lock and calls ``CreateCommunicator`` only on a MISS.
    Creating each clique once here — from the main thread, inside a jit small
    enough (one 8-byte buffer, <= 8 thunks) that XLA takes
    ``ThunkExecutor::ExecuteSequential`` and runs the thunk inline on the
    caller — makes every later acquisition a cache hit, so the guard is never
    evaluated again.  Verified live with ``TF_CPP_VMODULE=cpu_cliques=3``:
    three cliques per rank, created during warm-up, never re-created.

    WHICH CLIQUES.  Exactly the ones the program will touch: one per mesh
    axis, plus one over all axes together.  This is **per-clique**, and the
    discriminating controls (job 7881053) are unambiguous — warming the world
    clique ALONE fails, ``x`` alone fails, ``x+y`` without the world fails,
    and only ``x + y + world`` passes.  An earlier helper in
    ``common.contract_bands`` warmed the world clique only, which is exactly
    the failing cell; that is why the "world-collective-first contract" looked
    falsified.  Warm-up does matter — it was warming the wrong device sets.

    COST.  Three 8-byte ``psum``s for a 2-D mesh; ~150 ms once per process at
    P=4, ``O(log P)`` in latency, independent of ``N_mu``/``N_k``/``N_q``.  It
    adds nothing to any solver iteration and leaves the compiled HLO of every
    downstream kernel untouched, so it cannot move the collective table or the
    allocation table.

    WHY NOT THE WRAPPER OVERRIDE.  ``LORRAX_MPI_FORCE_THREAD_MAIN`` also
    works, but it is a patched MPI shim every user must build, and it is
    strictly less safe: it lets XLA call ``MPI_Comm_split`` — which is
    collective over ``MPI_COMM_WORLD`` — from arbitrary pool workers.
    ``AcquireCommunicator`` serialises creation *within* a process but nothing
    serialises it *across* ranks, so two cliques becoming ready in different
    orders on different ranks is a latent deadlock.  Warming from one thread
    in a program-defined order before any jit runs removes that exposure.
    (The wrapper's OTHER override, the ``MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE`` upgrade, is
    still required and is unrelated — see docs/dev/mpi_collectives.md.)

    MUST be called synchronously on every rank: it is a collective.  A no-op
    off the mpi implementation, in single-process runs, and on a mesh already
    warmed in this process.  Returns the elapsed seconds (0.0 when a no-op).
