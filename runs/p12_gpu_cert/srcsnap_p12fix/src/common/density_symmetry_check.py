"""Load-time MEASUREMENT of the symmetries a WFN file only *claims*.

Why this module exists
======================
A BerkeleyGW ``WFN.h5`` carries a symmetry block (``mtrx``/``tnp``/``ntran``)
and a k-point list with weights.  It does **not** carry a statement of
whether time-reversal symmetry (TRS) holds for the system the
wavefunctions describe, nor any independent confirmation that the stored
spatial operations really are symmetries of *these* wavefunctions.  For
years LORRAX inferred both from flags — ``ntran``, "was this a ``nosym``
deck", "QE usually TRS-folds" — and that inference chain produced a long
series of silent bugs, culminating in the ``ntran <= 1`` incident
(scorecard §Q) in which every ``nosym`` WFN read through the eager
backend had ψ(r) silently replaced by ψ*(−r): norm-, orthogonality- and
⟨T⟩-preserving, and therefore invisible to every internal consistency
check that existed.

The cure is to stop inferring and start measuring.  The occupied
wavefunctions themselves contain the answer: form the spin-resolved
charge density from them and ask the density what symmetries it has.

    1. TRS.   m(r) = Σ_k w_k Σ_occ ψ†(r) σ ψ(r).  Time reversal maps
              the occupied manifold at k to the one at −k with
              m_{−k}(r) = −m_k(r), so for every k-pair (k, −k) present
              in the file, ``w_k m_k + w_{−k} m_{−k}`` must vanish.  A
              TRS-broken (magnetic) system violates this pointwise.
    2. Spatial ops.  For each claimed ``{S|τ}`` the density built from
              the k-points that ``S`` leaves invariant must satisfy
              ρ(Sr + τ) = ρ(r).
    3. Invariants.  ∫ρ d³r = N_elec and ρ ≥ 0.

The verdict from (1) is stored on the loader as ``trs_holds`` and is
consulted by :class:`common.symmetry_maps.SymMaps`, which refuses to
select time-reversal rows when the density says TRS is broken —
regardless of what the flags imply.  Correctness of the unfold for
magnetic systems is thereby protected *structurally*, not by convention.

Non-circularity
===============
Everything here is computed from the **raw IBZ coefficients** exactly as
they sit in the file.  The symmetry unfold is the thing under test, so
it is never used: no ``unfold_psi``, no ``k='full_bz'``, no ``SymMaps``.
The only shared machinery is the density quadrature itself
(:func:`psp.get_DFT_mtxels.valence_density_from_kpoint`, imported, never
re-derived) and the G→FFT-box index table
(:meth:`file_io.wfn_loader.WfnLoader.box_index` with ``k='ibz'``, which
reads ``wfns/gvecs`` directly).

THE TRS ALGEBRA, WRITTEN OUT SO IT CAN BE AUDITED
=================================================
Everything below is spin-1/2 (``nspinor == 2``), BGW/LORRAX conventions.
The companion derivation for the *unfold* side lives in
``common.symmetry_maps.unfold_psi``; the two must agree and are
cross-checked in ``tests/test_symmetry_unfold.py``.

**(T1) The operator.**  Time reversal for spin-1/2 is the ANTIUNITARY

    Θ = i σ_y K,        K = complex conjugation,
    i σ_y = [[0, 1], [−1, 0]]   (this is ``symmetry_maps._I_SIGMA_Y``),
    Θ² = −1                      (Kramers).

**(T2) Action on a Bloch spinor, in real space and in G space.**  With
``ψ_nk(r) = Σ_G c_nk(G) e^{i(k+G)·r}`` and ``ψ = (a, b)ᵀ``:

    (Θψ_nk)(r) = i σ_y ψ*_nk(r) = (b*(r), −a*(r))ᵀ
               = Σ_G [i σ_y c*_nk(G)] e^{−i(k+G)·r}
               = Σ_G' [i σ_y c*_nk(−G')] e^{i(−k+G')·r}      (G' = −G)

so ``Θψ_nk`` is a Bloch state at **−k** whose coefficients are

    c_{Θn,−k}(G') = i σ_y  conj( c_nk(−G') ).                        (★)

Note the two separate pieces of (★): the spinor factor ``iσ_y·conj``
AND the **negation of the G list**.  Dropping the second half while
keeping the first is precisely the scorecard-§Q corruption
(``ψ(r) → ψ*(−r)``), which is why the two must always be reasoned about
together.

**(T3) What Θ does to the magnetization density.**  With
``m_ψ(r) = ψ†(r) σ ψ(r)`` and ``φ = iσ_y ψ*``:

    φ† σ_i φ = ψᵀ (iσ_y)† σ_i (iσ_y) ψ*  =  ψᵀ σ_y σ_i σ_y ψ*
             = −ψᵀ σ_i* ψ*                [σ_y σ_i σ_y = −σ_i*, all i]
             = −(ψ† σ_i ψ)*  =  −ψ† σ_i ψ  [m is real]

    ⇒  m_{Θψ}(r) = − m_ψ(r).                                        (★★)

Combining (★★) with (T2): **if the occupied manifold at k is carried by
Θ onto the occupied manifold at −k, then**

    m_{−k}(r) = − m_k(r)    pointwise in r.                       (★★★)

(★★★) is the identity this module measures, and it is the whole test.
Note what it does NOT involve: no symmetry operation, no rotation
matrix, no fractional translation τ, no umklapp vector, no spinor
rotation ``U_spinor``.  It is a statement about two real-space fields.
That is deliberate — it makes the TRS verdict independent of every
convention that has historically been got wrong here.

**(T4) Self-paired k (TRIM) and umklapp.**  When ``−k ≡ k + G₀`` for a
reciprocal-lattice vector ``G₀``, the state sets at ``−k`` and ``k`` are
the same states (a shift of G₀ only relabels the coefficient list; the
real-space Bloch function is unchanged), so (★★★) collapses to
``m_k(r) = −m_k(r)``, i.e. ``m_k ≡ 0`` at every TRIM.  This module
detects that case as ``pair[i] == i`` — the pairing is computed modulo
the k-grid in integer coordinates, so umklapp is handled by the
arithmetic and never appears explicitly.  Because the comparison is
made between real-space DENSITIES and never between coefficient lists,
no ``G₀`` bookkeeping is possible to get wrong.

**(T5) Does the band cut-off respect (★★★)?**  ``nocc = max(ifmax)``
is a band-INDEX cut.  Under TRS ``ε_{n,−k} = ε_{n,k}`` band by band, so
the same index cut selects Θ-corresponding manifolds at k and −k — the
cut is TRS-consistent even for a metal.  The one genuine hazard is a
cut that lands INSIDE a degenerate multiplet, where the diagonaliser's
arbitrary ordering among degenerate partners differs between k and −k;
the check therefore reports ``manifold_gap`` (the smallest
``ε[nocc] − ε[nocc−1]`` over the sampled k) and says so explicitly in
any failure message, so an auditor can rule that channel in or out.
Every LORRAX production deck is a gapped insulator where this cannot
arise.

NON-SYMMORPHIC OPS AND SPINORS: WHERE THEY DO AND DO NOT ENTER
==============================================================
**They do not enter the TRS arm at all** — see (T3).  This is the single
most important thing to know when auditing: a bug in the τ-phase, in
``U_spinor``, or in the umklapp vector cannot move the TRS verdict.

**They enter the spatial arm only through the point mapping.**  The
spatial test asks whether ``ρ(Sr + τ) = ρ(r)``.  Write the action of
``{S|τ}`` on a spinor Bloch state at a k in its little group:

    ψ_n{Sk}(r) = U_spinor(S) · ψ_{n'k}({S|τ}⁻¹ r) · e^{iχ}

for some unitary mixing within the degenerate/occupied manifold and
some phase χ (which carries the τ-phase and any umklapp ``e^{iG₀·r}``).
Forming ``ρ = Σ_n ψ†ψ``:

  * the phase ``e^{iχ}`` cancels — ρ is a modulus;
  * ``U_spinor`` cancels — ρ is a spinor TRACE, ``ψ†U†Uψ = ψ†ψ``;
  * the unitary mixing within the occupied manifold cancels — ρ is the
    trace of the manifold projector.

**Only the real-space point map ``r → mtrx⁻¹·r + τ/2π`` survives**, and
that is exactly what :func:`_grid_permutation` builds.  Consequences,
both worth knowing:

  * *Good*: the spatial arm is immune to the spinor and phase
    conventions, so a residual there is unambiguously a wrong
    ``mtrx``/``tnp``, not a bookkeeping slip elsewhere.  It is validated
    on ``si_cohsex_debug``, which is genuinely NON-SYMMORPHIC
    (``tnp = π`` ⇒ ``τ_frac = 1/2`` glides): all 48 ops pass at ≤3e-9.
  * *Limitation, stated plainly*: because ``U_spinor`` and the τ-phase
    cancel out of ρ, this check does **not** validate them.  It
    validates ``mtrx``, ``tnp`` and the TRS verdict.  ``U_spinor`` and
    the τ-phase are covered by ``tests/test_symmetry_unfold.py`` and by
    the §Q shape guard in ``unfold_psi``.  Extending the spatial arm to
    ``m`` (which transforms as an AXIAL vector, ``m(Sr+τ) = det(R)·R·m(r)``
    with ``R`` the CARTESIAN rotation) would test the spinor half too;
    that is deliberate future work, not an oversight.

**(S1) Why the τ commensurability guard exists.**  ``{S|τ}`` is a grid
permutation only when ``τ_frac × FFTgrid`` is integral.  QE chooses FFT
grids that satisfy this for the ops it stores, but a hand-edited or
converted file need not.  Rather than round and silently compare the
wrong points, :func:`_grid_permutation` returns ``None`` and the op is
reported as *untested* — never as *passed*.

Two design points that are easy to get wrong
============================================
**Why the k-pairing form of the TRS test and not "‖m_total‖ = 0".**
The IBZ-weighted magnetization Σ_k w_k m_k does *not* vanish for a
nonmagnetic system whenever the file's IBZ was reduced using TRS: the
weights then count both k̄'s spatial star and its time-reversed image,
but the stored ψ only supplies the k̄ half.  MoS₂ (D₃ₕ, no inversion,
strong spin-valley coupling) is exactly that case — m at the K valley is
large and opposite at K′, and a TRS-folded IBZ keeps only one of them.
Summing over ± *pairs that are both present in the file* is the
formulation that is exactly zero under TRS with no symmetrization step,
hence no circularity and no false alarm.

**Why the coverage is always adequate where it matters.**  A k-pair is
testable iff −k is also in the file's k list.  A deck whose IBZ was
reduced with TRS has poor coverage — but QE only performs TRS folding
when time reversal is *assumed*, and a genuinely magnetic system can
never produce such a mesh; its k-set is spatially reduced only, and a
spatially-reduced (or ``nosym``, full-BZ) mesh is closed under k → −k.
So the cases where TRS can actually be broken are precisely the cases
where this check has full coverage.  Coverage is reported either way.

**Why the spatial-op test restricts to each op's little group.**  The
raw IBZ-weighted ρ is *not* point-group symmetric (it is the
unsymmetrized precursor of ρ_full); testing it against a general op
would flag every legitimate op.  Symmetrizing it first would make the
test circular.  Restricting to the k-points that ``S`` fixes gives a
partial density that a true symmetry *must* leave invariant, using
nothing but raw ψ.  For a Γ-centred mesh Γ is in every op's little
group, so every op is tested.

Cost (measured, Frontera CPU, scorecard §U)
===========================================
Occupied bands only, on the ψ FFT box, with a ±-closed k-subsample
(``LORRAX_TRS_MAX_K``, default 12).  The subsample costs nothing in
rigour: each ± pair is an independent exact test, so a subset is a
*sharper* statement than the sum (no cancellation between pairs can
mask a violation).

    deck                              grid        nk    check
    cohsex_debug  (ntran=12, nk=4)    15x15x60     4    1.4 s
    gnppm_debug   (ntran=2,  nk=9)    24x24x80     9    1.2 s
    bispinor_debug(ntran=2,  nk=9)    30x30x120    9    2.7 s
    si_cohsex     (ntran=48, nk=8)    24x24x24     8    0.4 s
    MoS2 12x12    (ntran=1,  nk=144)  36x36x135   12    4.8 s

Second and later constructions of the same file are free (the verdict is
cached per (path, mtime, size) for the process; measured 0.01 s).

One caveat worth knowing: on a COLD Frontera node the first
``import psp.get_DFT_mtxels`` measures ~49 s and the first
``jnp.fft.ifftn`` ~8 s — both pure Lustre page-cache effects on the
import graph (``import jax`` itself goes 8.1 s cold → 1.5 s warm the same
way).  Warm, that import is 0.39 s.  The check's own arithmetic is the
table above; it does not do 50 s of work anywhere.

    source of truth for the density quadrature (ortho IFFT × √(N/Ω)) —
    so this cannot drift from the production ρ used for V_H.

    DERIVATION (audit me).  With the BGW Pauli convention
    ``σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]``, ``σ_y = [[0,−i],[i,0]]``,
    ``σ_z = [[1,0],[0,−1]]`` and ``ψ = (a, b)ᵀ``:

        m_x = ψ†σ_x ψ  = a*b + b*a        = 2·Re(a* b)
        m_y = ψ†σ_y ψ  = −i a*b + i b*a   = 2·Im(a* b)
        m_z = ψ†σ_z ψ  = |a|² − |b|²

    Writing ``D(·)`` for the imported quadrature (which is linear in
    ``|·|²`` and sums over whatever spinor axis it is handed), the four
    components follow from it alone — no second quadrature is written
    anywhere in LORRAX:

        ρ   = D(a) + D(b)
        m_z = D(a) − D(b)
        m_x = D(a + b)  − ρ     since |a+b|²  = ρ + 2Re(a*b) = ρ + m_x
        m_y = ρ − D(a + ib)     since |a+ib|² = ρ − 2Im(a*b) = ρ − m_y

    (``|a+ib|² = |a|² + |b|² + 2Re(a*·ib) = ρ + 2Re(i a*b) = ρ − 2Im(a*b)``.)
    Cost: 4 quadrature calls instead of the 2 a bespoke kernel would
    need — the deliberate price of having exactly one FFT-normalisation
    convention in the code base.

    ``m`` is None when the wavefunctions are scalar (``nspinor == 1``),
