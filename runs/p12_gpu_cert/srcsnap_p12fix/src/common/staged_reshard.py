"""``face_to_batch_reshard`` — the STAGED face→batch reshard.

The movement-only sibling of :mod:`common.contract_bands`.  Where that
module stages a *contraction* so no ``(μ, μ)``-class tile ever lands on
one rank, this one stages a pure **layout change** that the SPMD
partitioner cannot perform in one step and silently degrades to
replicate-then-repartition::

    (B, M, N)   P(None, 'x', 'y')      →     P(('x','y'), None, None)
    "face":  every rank owns the whole  "batch": every rank owns WHOLE
    batch on its own (M/px, N/py) tile   (M, N) matrices for its own B-rows

Both layouts hold exactly ``B·M·N / (px·py)`` elements per rank, so this
is volume-preserving in both directions.  XLA still refuses it: the tile
multisets are ``{1, px, py}`` and ``{px·py, 1, 1}``, which are not a
permutation of one another, so ``GetReshardAllToAllSourceTargetDims``
does not match and GSPMD takes its documented last resort — replicate
the tensor on every device, then slice.  Its own diagnostic, from the
91-Q MoS2 4x4 exciton path (job 7882974, ``rank`` 672, ``bs`` 64)::

    [SPMD] Involuntary full rematerialization.  The compiler cannot go
    from sharding {devices=[1,8,8]<=[64]} to {devices=[64,1,1]<=[64]}
    efficiently for ... c128[64,84,84] ... jit(_q_batch)/
    sharding_constraint ...  As the last resort, SPMD will replicate the
    tensor and then partition it, which is inefficient.  (b/433785288)

One warning per rank per site; the replicated intermediate is
``B·M·N·16`` bytes per device (462 MB at P=64 on that deck, 231 MB at
P=16) against a 7.2 MB true shard — a 64× per-rank residency blow-up
that is exactly the failure mode the LORRAX scaling target forbids.

WHY STAGING WORKS
-----------------
Split the move into the two single-mesh-axis exchanges it really is, and
each one IS a tile permutation::

    stage 1   P(None, 'x', 'y')  →  P('x', None, 'y')     all_to_all over 'x'
              tiles [1, px, py]  →  [px, 1, py]           split B, concat M
    stage 2   P('x', None, 'y')  →  P(('x','y'), None, None)
              tiles [px, 1, py]  →  [px·py, 1, 1]         split B, concat N

Stage 2's tile multiset still is not a permutation *of the whole mesh* —
but it is one **within each 'x' group**, which is precisely what
``lax.all_to_all(..., 'y', ...)`` expresses and what the partitioner
could not infer.  Issuing both exchanges by hand inside ONE ``shard_map``
(``check_rep=False``) is therefore not an optimisation hint but a
structural guarantee: the partitioner cannot hoist, merge or re-plan
collectives written inside a manual-axis region (the per_q lesson,
QUALITY_PATTERNS §4; the same reason
``contract_bands_block_reshard`` puts its psum_scatters there).

PER-RANK RESIDENCY (the owner's hard constraint)
------------------------------------------------
Every intermediate in the chain is exactly one shard::

    in       (B,        M/px, N/py)   =  B·M·N/(px·py)
    stage 1  (B/px,     M,    N/py)   =  B·M·N/(px·py)
    stage 2  (B/(px·py), M,   N)      =  B·M·N/(px·py)

so the count of live shard-class intermediates is 2 at each collective
(source + destination) and never more — the same count the unstaged form
already had, with the *replicated* member of that pair removed.  Peak
per-rank residency for this array therefore FALLS by ``px·py``; it
cannot rise.  No staging buffer is introduced.

TWO ROUTES THROUGH THE SAME MOVE  (``route=``)
---------------------------------------------
There is more than one pair of exchanges that lands on the output
layout, and which one is faster is a MEASUREMENT, not a derivation.  Both
are implemented; ``route`` selects::

  "split_b_first"  (default, the shipped one)
      (B, M_x, N_y)  →  (B_x, M, N_y)  →  (B_xy, M, N)
      all_to_all ax_x  (split B, concat M)      1 exchange, p_x peers
      all_to_all ax_y  (split B, concat N)      1 exchange, p_y peers

  "flatten_m_first"  (proposed by the owner, 2026-07-31:
      "q,mu_X,nu_Y -> q,mu_XY,nu -> q_XY,mu,nu ... i think that's most
      efficient")
      (B, M_x, N_y)  →  (B, M_xy, N)  →  (B_xy, M, N)
      all_to_all ax_y            (split M, concat N)   p_y peers
      all_to_all (ax_x, ax_y)    (split B, concat M)   p_x·p_y peers

Both are volume-preserving at every step and both are pure movement, so
they are the same bit-exact parity class.  They differ in

* **divisibility.**  ``split_b_first`` needs ``M % p_x`` and ``N % p_y``
  (the input layout's own requirement) plus ``B % (p_x·p_y)``.
  ``flatten_m_first`` additionally needs ``M % (p_x·p_y)``, because its
  intermediate cuts M over the FLATTENED axis.  On the MoS2 4x4 exciton
  deck M = rank = nk·nb = 672 and 672 % 64 = 32, so at P=64 that route
  needs M padded to 704 (+4.76 %).  ``pad_m`` does exactly that, locally,
  and drops the pad rows again with a static gather at the end — see
  :func:`face_to_batch_reshard` — so the padding cost is paid by the
  route that needs it and by nothing else.
* **peer count.**  Two exchanges over p_x and p_y peers versus one over
  p_y and one over p_x·p_y.  Payload is ``(1 − 1/p)`` of a shard each
  way, so ``split_b_first`` moves 1.75 shards at 8x8 against 1.86, and
  its largest replica group is 8 rather than 64.  On this machine these
  collectives measured COUNT-bound rather than bandwidth-bound, which
  predicts ``split_b_first`` wins — a hypothesis the harness tests, not a
  reason to skip testing it.

ORDER OF THE TWO STAGES (§3.2 of the staged-reshard doctrine)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The two payloads within ``split_b_first`` are equal — ``(1 − 1/p)`` of
one shard each — so the axis order is not a payload decision as it is in
``contract_bands_block_reshard``.  It is fixed by the OUTPUT layout
instead: ``P((ax, ay), None, None)`` numbers its B-blocks ``ax``-major,
so B must be cut by ``ax`` first and by ``ay`` second, and rank
``(x, y)`` then holds block ``x·py + y`` exactly as the spec says.  The
happy consequence is that the FINAL exchange rides ``ay`` — the mesh's
minor axis, whose replica groups are consecutive ranks (node-local pairs
at 2 ranks/node on the production layout).  The module still REFUSES a
mesh whose minor axis is not ``ay``, because on such a mesh the block
numbering the caller asked for and the groups the collectives use stop
agreeing.  ``flatten_m_first`` reaches the same numbering by a different
schedule: its first exchange gives rank ``(x, y)`` M-block ``x·py + y``,
and its second hands out B over the flattened axis in the same
``ax_x``-major order, so the two routes' outputs are element-identical.

Evidence pointer for the pattern itself: ``common.symmetry_maps``'s
``unfold_v_q`` has shipped the same ``shard_map`` + ``lax.all_to_all``
volume-preserving redistribution (with the same explicit divisibility
refusal) since the TRS/umklapp work.  This module is that idiom lifted
out of one call site and given a contract.

MEASURED, first adopter (``bandstructure.bse_setup``'s ``_q_batch``;
job 7883154 against 7882974, same deck, same args, same harness,
cache-cold, coll=mpi).  ``htransform_psi_cQ`` on the 91-Q MoS2 4x4 path::

    P=64   231.39 -> 145.53 s   1.59x    involuntary-remat lines 64 -> 0
    P=16   175.96 -> 186.13 s   0.95x    involuntary-remat lines 16 -> 0

so the P=64/P=16 ratio goes 1.32 -> 0.78.  The P=16 row is stated as
measured: at 16 devices the replicated batch this removes is only
231 MB and the two exchanges run over 4-device groups, so the trade is
close to even and came out ~6% the wrong way.  The primitive's value is
therefore claim-scoped to the regime it was built for — device counts
where ``B·M·N`` replicated per rank is the binding cost — and the
measured domain is CPU/``impl=mpi``/2 ranks per node; no GPU walltime of
this module exists.  Values: byte-identical .dat at both P.

Gate: ``tests/test_staged_reshard.py`` — value parity against the
unstaged chain, an HLO pin (2 ``all-to-all``, zero full-batch
``all-gather``), and a RED TWIN that compiles the unstaged chain in a
subprocess and requires the compiler's own
``Involuntary full rematerialization`` line to appear.  An instrument
that has not been shown failing is not an instrument (wk_REL README §5.1).

        ``(major, minor)`` mesh axis names.  ``axes[0]`` carries the M

    ``reshard(a)`` — takes ``(B, M, N)`` laid out ``P(ax_x_face)`` i.e.
