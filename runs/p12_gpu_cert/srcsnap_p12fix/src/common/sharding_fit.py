"""A ``PartitionSpec`` that is LEGAL for the extents actually in hand.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
LORRAX has two conventions for the ISDF centroid extent ``n_mu`` and they
disagree:

* ``bse.bse_io`` **pads** it — ``runtime.padding.padded_mu_extent(n_mu,
  px*py)`` — before it shards anything, so its tiles always divide the mesh.
* ``bandstructure.bse_setup`` and ``bse.vq_interp`` shard the **raw** count.

``n_mu`` is a k-means output, so the raw count divides the mesh axis only by
luck.  The MoS2 4x4 deck's 800-centroid set has 785 unique centroids;
785 = 5 x 157, which divides neither 4 nor 8.  Every ``exciton_bands`` run on
that deck therefore died at **every** P > 1 with

    IndivisibleError: Sharding NamedSharding(..., spec=P(None, None, None,'y'))
    implies that array axis 3 is partitioned 4 times, but the dimension size
    is 785   (full shape: (208, 4, 2, 785))

— ``bandstructure/bse_setup.py::_make_bundle``, job 7882476 cell exb16s at
P=16 and, with a second offender (a 4-band window over an 8-wide mesh), cell
exb64s at P=64.  It went unnoticed because the published 12x12 reference used
n_mu = 640 on a 4x4 mesh (640/4 = 160) and the 6x6 fixture n_mu = 1496 on 4x4
(374): both divisible by accident.  The same arithmetic refuses
``vq_interp``'s (mu, nu) face shardings, and refuses its q-batch sharding
outright on any deck with fewer BZ q-points than devices (a 4x4x1 grid has
nq = 16; at P = 64 there is nothing to split).

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
---------------------
:func:`legal_spec` returns the requested spec unchanged when every sharded
axis divides evenly — the SAME object, so nothing about a currently-working
run moves, not one byte of HLO — and otherwise returns it with the offending
mesh axes dropped, i.e. that array dimension replicated (or, for a tuple
entry, only PARTLY replicated; see "partial retention" below).

This is a **placement** decision, not an algorithmic one.  Replicating a
dimension changes where operands live; it does not change any contraction,
any reduction order, or any collective the jitted body issues.  Values are
unaffected.

WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT
---------------------------------
Per-device memory for that array rises by the dropped factor, so this is a
correctness floor, not a scaling strategy.  It is ANNOUNCED once per distinct
(site, spec, shape) — with the per-device byte cost spelled out — so the
degradation can never be silent.  The failure it replaces was loud; the
success it produces must not be quietly expensive.

PARTIAL RETENTION (tuple entries)
---------------------------------
``P(('x','y'), ...)`` flattens BOTH mesh axes onto one array dimension, so the
divisor is the product.  When the product does not divide but a sub-product
does, dropping the whole entry replicates ``px*py`` ways where ``px`` ways
were available for free.  The exb wall is exactly that case: a 32-wide q-batch
on an 8x8 mesh is indivisible by 64, divisible by 8.  :func:`legal_spec`
therefore keeps the largest order-preserving subset of the tuple whose product
divides — the same argument the single-axis case has always made ("drop THAT
axis and only that one"), applied inside a tuple.  Never more replication than
before, often 8x less.

THE DURABLE FIX IS TO NOT NEED THIS AT ALL
------------------------------------------
:func:`padded_extent` is the other half of the module and the one that should
be reached for first: pad the extent so the requested spec is legal, instead
of degrading the spec so the extent fits.

* ``bandstructure.bse_setup`` now pads its **q-batch** with it —
  ``padded_extent(mesh, ('x','y'), batch_size)``.  Measured on the MoS2 4x4
  deck, 91-Q exciton path: the 32-wide batch could not split 64 devices, so
  every device ran all 32 ``eigh`` instead of its own share, and
  ``htransform_psi_cQ`` cost 866.5 s at P=64 against 105.7 s at P=16 (jobs
  7882533 / 7882569) — 64 devices SLOWER than 16.
* ``mu`` is the remaining offender: ``bse.bse_io`` pads it
  (``runtime.padding.padded_mu_extent(n_mu, px*py)``) and ``bse.vq_interp``
  does not.  At the converged 12x12 / n_mu = 2412 reference on an 8x8 mesh
  (2412 % 8 = 4) ``build_cq``'s ``P(None,'x','y')`` degrades on BOTH face
  axes and this resolver replicates a 13.4 GB (12.484 GiB) C_q per device — a
  stop sign, not a shrug.  Padding n_mu to 2416 = round_up(2412, 8) makes the
  face legal and the same tile costs 0.196 GiB (210 MB) per device, a factor
  64 down.  Single-axis entries have no partial
  retention to fall back on (a NamedSharding cannot split an array axis by a
  sub-factor of ONE mesh axis), so for C_q padding is the only lever.

Gated by ``tests/test_sharding_fit.py``, whose control establishes that jax
really does refuse the raw spec (a fitter for a non-problem would pass every
other assertion in that file and mean nothing).
