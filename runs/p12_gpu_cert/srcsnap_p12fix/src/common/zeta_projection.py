"""Project two-point objects between ISDF ζ bases of very different size.

Problem (owner directive 2026-07-29).  A production GW run fits a LARGE
ISDF basis over a wide band window (``μ_L`` ~ 10k centroids); a BSE /
post-processing consumer only needs a few valence and conduction bands
and wants the same physics in a SMALL basis (``μ_S`` ~ 500).  The object
to move is the screened interaction

    W_L[q, μ_L, ν_L]   →   W_S[q, μ_S, ν_S]

Both are two-point functions of the *same* field

    W_q(r, r') ≈ Σ_{μν} ζ_{q,μ}(r) · W[q,μ,ν] · conj(ζ_{q,ν}(r'))

so the change of basis is a **congruence with a rectangular transfer
matrix** ``T[q, μ_S, μ_L]``::

    W_S = T · W_L · T†                                            (★)

which is structurally the band projection this repo already owns —
``common.contract_bands.contract_bands_block_reshard`` — with
``ψ_left/ψ_right`` carrying ``T``/``T†`` and its ``k`` batch axis
carrying ``q``.  This module is that primitive's first non-Σ consumer;
it adds only (a) the operand construction and (b) the build of ``T``
itself from the two ζ sets.  Everything the primitive encodes (two-stage
psum_scatter so no ``(μ,μ)`` tile is ever gathered, large payload on the
node-local mesh axis, f64-split de-promotion, the vendor-BLAS GEMM dial,
the impl=mpi warm-up contract, actionable divisibility refusals) is
inherited unchanged — see ``docs/dev/staged_reshard_primitive.md``.

The metric convention (READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING THE ALGEBRA)
-------------------------------------------------------------
The discretized inner product of two ζ's in this codebase is fixed by
what ``gw.v_q_g_flat`` already does to build ``V_q`` — the module docstring
there states the contract::

    V_q[μ, ν] = Σ_G conj(ζ̃_{q,μ}(G)) · v(q+G) · ζ̃_{q,ν}(G)

over the per-q G-sphere, with ζ̃ the on-disk G-flat ζ:
``ζ̃_{q,μ}(G) = FFT[e^{-iq·r} ζ_{q,μ}(r)]`` at ``norm="backward"``
(``common.wfn_transforms.accumulate_rchunk_to_gflat``).  The ζ overlap is
therefore *the same contraction with the Coulomb weight set to one*::

    O[q, μ_S, μ_L] = Σ_G conj(ζ̃^S_{q,μ_S}(G)) · ζ̃^L_{q,μ_L}(G)      (†)

Three consequences that are easy to get wrong:

* **The e^{iq·r} phase cancels.**  Manual §5.1: ζ_{q,μ}(r) is a phase
  ``e^{+iq·r}`` times a cell-periodic ``z_{q,μ}(r)``.  Both bases are
  evaluated at the SAME q, so ``conj(ζ^S) ζ^L = conj(z^S) z^L`` — the
  G-flat (cell-periodic) buffers are exactly the right operands, no
  phase bookkeeping.
* **This is the sphere-truncated, N_r-scaled r-grid overlap.**  At
  ``norm="backward"`` Parseval gives ``Σ_G conj(z̃^S) z̃^L = N_r ·
  Σ_r conj(z^S(r)) z^L(r)`` when the sum runs over the full G box; the
  production sphere truncates it exactly the way ``V_q`` is truncated.
  We use the same metric ``V_q`` uses, not a different one.
* **Which is why the transfer is NOT the raw overlap.**  The
  least-squares transfer

        T = G_S^{-1} · O ,      G_S[q] = Σ_G conj(ζ̃^S) ζ̃^S           (‡)

  is invariant under ``metric → c · metric`` (both ``G_S`` and ``O``
  scale by ``c``), so the N_r factor and the sphere truncation cannot
  leak an arbitrary scale into ``W_S``.  A bare congruence with ``O``
  would scale as ``c²``.  ``T`` is also the *minimizer* of
  ``‖W_L(r,r') − W_S(r,r')‖_F`` over the small basis, and it is EXACT
  whenever the field is representable there (see
  :func:`least_squares_transfer` and the round-trip gate).  ``mode="raw"``
  exposes the bare-overlap congruence for callers who want it, and says
  so out loud.

``G_S`` is ``(n_q, μ_S, μ_S)`` — bounded by construction (μ_S is small:
that is the entire premise) and the ONLY replicated object here; it is
announced with its byte size at build time.

Every entry except ``G_S`` FALLS with P, and ``G_S`` is the small basis's
own Gram — it can never reach ``μ_L²``.  The overlap build (†) contracts
over **G, sharded flat over the whole mesh** — the r/G axis is the
parallel axis, exactly as required — and its rank-local partial is
bounded independently of P by chunking the μ_S axis
(``mu_s_chunk``), so no ``(μ_S, μ_L)``-full transient is forced either.

Two overlap plans (pick by what layout your ζ can be supplied in)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* :func:`zeta_overlap_block_reshard` — ζ sharded on **G only**; both
  shardings of ``O`` come out of one pass.  Convenient (one ζ layout)
  but its rank-local partial is μ_L-FULL, so its reduce-scatter payload
  is **P-independent** and the stage is FLAT in P (measured 6.9 / 6.8 /
  8.2 / 6.8 s at P = 4 / 16 / 64 / 144).
* :func:`zeta_overlap_single_axis` — ζ sharded on **μ_L and G**; the
  rank-local partial IS the output shard, so it needs ONE ``psum`` per
  output, no μ_S chunking, and a payload that FALLS with the mesh.
  Measured 5.26 / 2.43 / 2.22 / 1.26 s at the same four P — faster at
  every P and the only one that scales.  Costs one extra ζ layout
  (μ on 'x'/G on 'y' for ``O_x``, μ on 'y'/G on 'x' for ``O_y``).
  **Use this one unless you cannot produce the second layout.**

The two are gated against each other at production scale (they compute
the same matrix through structurally different collectives); measured
agreement 3.8e-16 … 1.0e-15 at P = 4 … 144.

Refusals (all raise BEFORE any collective, with the fix named)
--------------------------------------------------------------
* non-2-D mesh, or minor axis ≠ ``axes[1]`` (inherited from the
  primitive: the large payload must reduce-scatter over consecutive-rank
  groups);
* ``μ_L % p_x`` / ``μ_L % p_y`` / ``μ_S % p_x`` / ``μ_S % p_y`` ≠ 0;
* ``n_G % (p_x·p_y)`` ≠ 0 for the ζ operands;
* a Gram that is not positive definite (``mode="ls"``) — reported with
  the failing q and the suggestion to shrink the small basis or check
  for duplicate centroids.  No silent ridge, no silent pinv.

    The overlap (†) is ``Σ_G conj(ζ̃^S(G)) ζ̃^L(G)`` — a sum over a shared

    different G's at the same array position — in which case the overlap
    is silently meaningless.

    This is not hypothetical.  Measured on the MoS2 12×12 80 Ry decks:

    Checks, in order (each refusal names the fix): ζ layout, completeness

    """One-collective overlap with μ_L AND G both sharded — the scaling plan.

    ``zeta_overlap_block_reshard`` (above) shards ONLY G and therefore
    forms a rank-local partial that is μ_L-FULL: its reduce-scatter input
    is ``n_q·chunk·μ_L``, **independent of P**.  Measured consequence
    (jobs 7879488/7879491): the overlap stage is FLAT in P — 7.0 s at
    P=4 and 7.0 s at P=16 — while its arithmetic falls as 1/P.

    This plan removes that.  ζ_L is sharded on BOTH axes, μ_L over
    ``mu_axis`` and G over ``g_axis``; ζ_S is sharded on G over
    ``g_axis`` only (μ_S replicated — μ_S is small by premise).  Then::

        loc[q, μ_S, μ_L_local] = Σ_{G_local} conj(ζ^S) ζ^L    rank-local
        O                       = psum(loc, g_axis)

    is the whole thing: ONE all-reduce, whose payload
    ``n_q·μ_S·μ_L/p_mu`` FALLS with the mesh, and whose rank-local
    partial IS the output shard — so there is no transient larger than
    the result and no μ_S chunking is needed at all.  ``psum_scatter`` is
    unnecessary here precisely because μ_L is already tiled on entry.

    The cost is that the caller must supply ζ in two layouts, one per
    output sharding (μ on 'x'/G on 'y' for ``O_x``, μ on 'y'/G on 'x' for
    ``O_y``) — one reshard, or one re-read, or (as in the synthetic
    driver, where ζ is analytic) one regeneration.  That is the trade:
    a P-independent collective, or a one-off operand reshard.

    Operands (global shape → spec)::

        zeta_S  (n_q, μ_S, n_G)   P(None, None, g_axis)
        zeta_L  (n_q, μ_L, n_G)   P(None, mu_axis, g_axis)
        O       (n_q, μ_S, μ_L)   P(None, None, mu_axis)

    Per-rank ζ_S is ``n_q·μ_S·n_G/p_g`` — it falls with ``p_g``, not with
    P.  Stated rather than hidden: it is bounded by the SMALL basis
    (65 MB at n_q=16, μ_S=504, n_G=4032, p_g=8) and can never approach
    μ_L², but it is the one operand here that does not scale with the
    full mesh.

    set is linearly independent on the G-sphere.  Done INSIDE a shard_map
    with ``G_S`` replicated and ``O``'s μ_L axis sharded, so the solve is
    rank-local by construction and the partitioner is never asked to plan
    a collective for it.  **Refuses** (does not ridge, does not pinv)
    when the Cholesky fails, and names ``rcond`` as the fix.

    ``rcond=<float>`` — Hermitian eigendecomposition of ``G_S``, keeping
    the eigenvalues above ``rcond · λ_max`` per q and zeroing the rest:
    the Moore–Penrose pseudo-inverse truncated at a stated rank.  The
    retained rank is ANNOUNCED per q, because it is physics: it is the
    number of small-basis ζ's that are actually independent on the
    sphere, and if it is far below μ_S the small basis is not the size
    the caller thinks it is.

    **Why the truncated route is not optional on real data.**  Measured
    on the production MoS2 12×12 80 Ry ζ (job 7879532): the 606-centroid

    round-off on a positive-semidefinite matrix.  A real ISDF basis is
    strongly linearly dependent on its own sphere; the ISDF FIT already
    fights exactly this with ``charge_zeta_solve=rank_truncate`` and the
    RCOND dials.  The synthetic study could never have shown it
    (cond ≈ 20 there), which is why it had to be run on real ζ.
