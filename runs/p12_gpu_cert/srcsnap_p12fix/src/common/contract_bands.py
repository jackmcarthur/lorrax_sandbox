"""contract_bands_block_reshard — THE multi-stage band projection + reshard.

Single source of truth (owner directive, 2026-07-28) for the pattern

    out[extra?, k, m, n] = Σ_{s,μ} Σ_{s',ν}  conj(ψ_left)[k, m, s, μ]
                           · O[extra?, k, s, μ, s', ν] · ψ_right[k, s', ν, n]

executed as a TWO-STAGE psum_scatter chain on the 2-D ('x','y') mesh, so
that **no (m, n, k)-, (m, μ)- or (μ, μ)-sized object is ever materialized
on one rank** — that is this primitive's raison d'être (LORRAX scaling
target: thousands of low-memory processes; an N_μ² or band-cube tile on a
single rank is the failure mode this module exists to make structurally
impossible).  The output leaves the chain already block-sharded
(m on 'x', n on 'y'); every partial bigger than the final tile lives only
as a rank-local shard between the two collectives.

Structure (per rank, inside one shard_map)::

    right    = einsum(O_local, ψ_right_local)     contract (s', ν_Y-local)
    right_rs = psum_scatter(right, 'y', dim=n)    LARGE payload, 'y' groups
    left     = einsum(conj(ψ_left_local), right_rs)  contract (s, μ_X-local)
    out      = psum_scatter(left, 'x', dim=m)     small payload, 'x' groups

Adopters (2026-07-28): the two Σ_c(τ) projection tails in
``gw.ppm_tau_kernel`` (two-channel crossing plan + merged Laplace plan).
Slated (owner review pending, wk_REL/contract_bands_notes.md §BSE):
``bse.bse_stack_matvec._w_stack`` decode, the ``bse_ring_comm`` matvec
family, ``vq_interp`` V_Q assembly.

Encoded policies (each measured; evidence cited inline)
-------------------------------------------------------
1. **Large-payload-on-the-node-local-axis** (owner-approved axis-order
   swap, 2026-07-28): the ν/'y'-side contraction runs FIRST, so the LARGE
   partial — the m-full ``(k, s, μ_X_loc, n)`` block — reduce-scatters
   over the 'y' mesh axis, whose replica groups are CONSECUTIVE ranks
   (node-local pairs at 2 ranks/node on the production layout; HLO
   module_0912 groups {8x..8x+7} vs stride-8 {y, y+8, ...} for 'x').
   Only the small final ``(k, m, n/p_y)`` block rides the zero-locality
   'x' groups.  This is why ψ_left is the 'x'/m-side operand and ψ_right
   the 'y'/n-side operand — the primitive REFUSES a mesh whose minor
   (consecutive-rank) axis is not the 'y' axis it scatters the large
   payload over.
2. **Stacked collectives** (AK.9): every channel/extra slice rides ONE
   collective per mesh axis (stack-then-scatter), never one collective
   per slice.  Bit-exact by construction (elementwise rank-sum is
   indifferent to concatenation); message count is flat in the stack
   extent.
3. **De-promoted f64-split lowering where operands are real**
   (wk_REL/RESHARD_OVERHEAD_MEMO.md Sec. 4.4, HLO-proven; measured
   project_rs 43.2 → 38.7 s at nb=128/P=64, job 7878942): whenever the
   large right contraction would be mixed f64 × c128, XLA:CPU (and GPU)
   PROMOTES the real operand to c128 — a ~400 MB materialization per
   channel at production shape — and runs a full complex GEMM at 2× the
   required flops.  This module instead splits the COMPLEX ψ_right into
   its f64 parts and issues pure-f64 dgemms + one ``lax.complex``
   recombine.  Applied automatically when ``O`` (or a derived channel)
   is real; genuinely complex × complex contractions are left as single
   complex GEMMs — the f64 split was tried there and REFUTED by
   measurement (Eigen dgemm ~172 GF/s is per-flop BELOW its zgemm's
   295 at these shapes; job 7878942, refutation recorded in
   ``gw.ppm_tau_kernel._project_x_local``'s history).
4. **The impl=mpi mesh-clique warm-up** (corrected 2026-07-29).  Under
   ``JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION=mpi`` jaxlib refuses to CREATE a
   communicator from any thread but the MPI-initialising one
   (``MPI_Is_thread_main`` in
   ``xla::cpu::MpiCollectives::CreateCommunicators``), and XLA:CPU's
   parallel ``ThunkExecutor`` issues collective thunks from intra-op pool
   workers — so a clique whose FIRST use is inside a real jitted program
   dies on every rank.  The factory therefore calls
   :func:`common.collectives.warm_mesh_cliques` before returning, which
   creates each clique once from the main thread; XLA then serves every
   later acquisition from its process-global clique cache.

   This SUPERSEDES the earlier ``ensure_grouped_collectives_ready``, which
   warmed the WORLD clique only.  The controls (job 7881053) show world-only
   FAILS, as do x-only and x+y-without-world; only x+y+world passes.  The
   old "world-collective-first contract" was right that warm-up matters and
   wrong about which device sets to warm — the caching is **per-clique**.
5. **Divisibility guard with an actionable refusal**: the two
   psum_scatters split m over p_x and n over p_y; an indivisible window
   would crash cryptically deep inside psum_scatter.  The wrapper
   converts that into an error that names the fix (pad m and n
   INDEPENDENTLY per axis — never to the p_x·p_y product, which wastes
   up to 3.16× tile; audit fix/zq 2026-07-28).

Gated CPU GEMM body (LORRAX_BANDS_GEMM_FFI; AUTO default 2026-07-29)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The large right contraction is the measured wall of this pattern — 71% of
the Σ project_rs row, running 4.3–7.3× below the node's BLAS roofline
through XLA:CPU's Eigen dots (295 GF/s promoted zgemm / ~172 GF/s split
dgemm vs 1263 GF/s MKL, memo Sec. 4.4/4.5; the bare Eigen dot saturates
1.6–1.9× below vendor BLAS at full threads — jobs 7879008/7879010).
The dial routes ONLY that right contraction through the vendor-BLAS GEMM
host FFI handler; everything else — channel algebra, collectives, the
small left dots (1.6e-3 of the right's flops, measured) — is untouched.

The dial ITSELF is a microservice: ``ffi.mklblas`` owns its grammar,
platform resolution, capability probe, announcements, refusals and the
``ffi_call`` (handler ``lorrax_mklblas_gemm_batch``,
src/ffi/cpp/mklblas).  ``docs/dev/vendor_gemm_service.md`` is its
contract, ``docs/dev/ffi_gate_contract.md`` the gate doctrine it
implements.  Default is AUTO (owner order 2026-07-29, doctrine #8:
capability detection, not policy) — ON when the platform is CPU AND the
handler resolves in the host .so, announced once, and quietly native
everywhere it cannot apply.

What belongs to THIS module, and is enforced here, is only what a GEMM
service cannot know: WHICH contraction is routed, and that
``extra="minor"`` is excluded — a fact about this primitive's operand
layout, not about BLAS (the contracted axis is not reachable by a strided
batched GEMM without a full-tile transpose copy, which would cost what
the handler saves).  Under AUTO the minor order quietly keeps the XLA
plan; under an explicit ``=1`` it REFUSES, like every other unhonorable
explicit request.  ``input_output_aliases``: deliberately NONE — a GEMM
output (B, M, N) never matches an operand buffer shape, so no alias is
legal (contrast the in-place FFT handlers).  Read at FACTORY time:
kernel caches must key on :func:`bands_gemm_ffi_enabled` (ppm_tau_kernel
does).

Canonical operand layout (global shapes → mesh specs)
-----------------------------------------------------
::

    ψ_left   (nk, m, s, μ)          P(None, None, None, 'x')
    O        (nk, s, μ, s', ν)      P(None, None, 'x', None, 'y')
      extra="leading": (E, nk, s, μ, s', ν)   P(None, None, None, 'x', None, 'y')
      extra="minor":   (nk, s, μ, s', ν, E)   P(None, None, 'x', None, 'y', None)
    ψ_right  (nk, s', ν, n)         P(None, None, 'y', None)
    out      (nk, m, n)             P(None, 'x', 'y')   (+E leading/minor)

``s``/``s'`` are the spinor axes (size 1 is fine); ``conj`` is applied to
ψ_left inside the body (ψ† σ ψ semantics; pass a pre-conjugated array if
you need the unconjugated form).  The optional ``extra`` axis is the
caller's stack — Σ channels, BSE trial blocks, a τ/ω batch — and rides
the stacked collectives of policy 2.  ``extra="leading"`` vs ``"minor"``
is a measured choice, not a style one: the unit gate microbenches both
orders at production local shapes and the winner is recorded in
wk_REL/contract_bands_notes.md (owner question — numbers, not opinions).

Envelope statement (design-envelope rule): all policies are flat in
n_atoms / N_μ / nk / nb / P; per-rank payloads scale as the SHARD sizes
(right partial ~ nb·μ/p_x per channel), never as a global tile; the
primitive lowers on CPU and GPU (shard_map + psum_scatter are
backend-neutral; the FFI dial is CPU-only and refused elsewhere).

    ----------
    mesh_xy
        The 2-D device mesh.  Its MINOR (last-named, consecutive-rank)
        axis must be ``axes[1]`` — policy 1 scatters the large partial
        over that axis and refuses an inverted mesh rather than silently
        shipping the big payload over the zero-locality groups.
    channels
        ``"none"``: one contraction chain at O's own dtype (complex O →
        single complex chain, exactly the merged Laplace plan; REAL O →
        de-promoted f64-split chain, policy 3).
        ``"split_reim"``: O must be complex; it is split elementwise into
        (Re O, Im O) BEFORE projection and each real channel rides its
        own de-promoted chain — the two-channel (S_R, S_I) plan required
        by consumers that weight the channels independently (crossing
        windows; channel algebra: gw.ppm_tau_kernel + manual §7.5).
        Returns the tuple ``(S_R, S_I)``, both complex.  Incompatible
        with ``extra`` (refused): stack the channel pair yourself as a
        real leading-extra operand if you need both.
    extra
        ``"none"`` | ``"leading"`` | ``"minor"`` — position of the
        caller's stack axis E (see canonical layout).  Both orders are
        first-class so the choice stays a measurement
        (wk_REL/contract_bands_notes.md records the microbench).
        ``"minor"`` always takes the XLA plan (structural: the
        contracted axis is not GEMM-reachable without a full-tile
        transpose copy) — use ``"leading"`` where the GEMM plan matters.
    axes
        Mesh axis names ``(ax_x, ax_y)``; ax_x shards μ/m, ax_y shards
        ν/n.  Default matches every production mesh.
    divisibility_hint
        Extra caller-specific text appended to the divisibility refusal.
