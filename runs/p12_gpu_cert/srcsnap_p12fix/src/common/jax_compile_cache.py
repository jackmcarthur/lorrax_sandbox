"""JAX persistent compile cache — SAFE and EFFECTIVE at ``process_count() > 1``.

Every LORRAX driver that does a meaningful amount of ``jax.jit``
compile (gw.gw_jax, psp.run_nscf, centroid.kmeans_isdf, bse.bse_jax,
bandstructure.htransform, ...) should call
:func:`ensure_jax_compile_cache` near the top of its ``main()`` — right
after ``jax.distributed.initialize`` (i.e. after ``runtime.bootstrap()``)
and BEFORE any jit.  Calling it late means the expensive compiles that
happen early in the pipeline miss the cache.

Knobs (all optional):

  ``ISDF_JAX_CACHE_DIR=/some/path``    — override cache location.
  ``ISDF_JAX_CACHE_DIR=""``             — opt out entirely.
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_MULTIPROCESS=0``   — restore the scorecard-AG refusal
                                          (no cache at all when P > 1).
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_AGREE_TIMEOUT_S``  — agreement timeout, default 300.
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_STRICT=0``         — on an agreed entry that then fails
                                          to load, warn instead of aborting
                                          (UNSAFE on GPU: can hang).
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_FORCE_DIVERGE=N``  — TEST HOOK (positive control): every
                                          rank != 0 pretends its N
                                          alphabetically-last cache entries
                                          are missing, forcing the agreement
                                          to drop them.
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_NO_AGREE=1``       — TEST HOOK: shared dir with the
                                          agreement layer DISABLED, i.e. the
                                          naive shared-dir design.  This is
                                          the deadlock reproducer; never use
                                          it in production.
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_EXPLAIN=1``        — turn on ``jax_explain_cache_misses``.
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_INVARIANT_KEY=0``  — TEST HOOK: do NOT make the cache key
                                          process-invariant.  At P > 1 this
                                          also switches the cache OFF, because
                                          hitting it would be unsafe (only
                                          process 0 could).
  ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_PREFETCH``         — pull the agreed entries into the
                                          page cache from a thread pool right
                                          after the agreement (default in
                                          ``_PREFETCH_DEFAULT``), with
                                          ``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_PREFETCH_THREADS``
                                          workers (16).

Default location (``ISDF_JAX_CACHE_DIR`` unset) is
``$SCRATCH/lorrax_jax_cache`` when ``$SCRATCH`` is set, else
``$XDG_CACHE_HOME``/``~/.cache`` + ``/isdf_jax_compilation`` — the resolved
default is announced once at init.  Entries live in ``{base}/np{N_proc}/``
— ONE directory shared by every rank of a world size (the old ``rank{i}/``
partitioning is gone; see below).

**Why ``$SCRATCH`` comes first.**  One entry is one small file, and a
populated world size is several hundred of them (301 for the gw fixture at
P=8, 886 measured for a big deck), so a default under ``/home1`` eats inodes
on the filesystem whose *inode* quota locks you out of the machine (ADVICE
section 2).  The cache is enabled by default, so the safe location has to be
the code's default rather than shell-alias advice.  Correctness does not
depend on this — the directory only has to be visible to every rank, which
``$SCRATCH`` and ``$WORK`` both are and ``/tmp`` is NOT.

The ``ISDF_*`` env-var naming is legacy — historically this was for ISDF
kernels only, now it caches the whole run.  Left as-is for backward
compat with existing user shell aliases and run scripts.

**Expect a wall of scary-looking XLA:CPU log lines on every warm run, and
ignore them.**  ``cpu_aot_loader.cc`` compares the feature list the entry was
compiled with against the host's and shouts

    E cpu_aot_loader.cc:220] Loading XLA:CPU AOT result. Target machine
    feature +prefer-no-gather is not supported on the host machine ...
    This could lead to execution errors such as SIGILL.

``prefer-no-gather`` / ``prefer-no-scatter`` are LLVM *cost-model pseudo-
features*: they exist at compile time and never appear in a runtime CPU
feature list, so this comparison mismatches on every load on every machine.
It is a ``LOG(ERROR)``, not a rejection — MEASURED on the same run that emits
738 of these lines: 369/373 cache hits and 4 compiles; and on htransform, 304
lines with 152/152 hits and ZERO compiles.  ADVICE section 4's "each forcing a
recompile" is not true of jax 0.9.1.

===========================================================================
WHY THIS FILE IS COMPLICATED: XLA:GPU COMPILATION IS A COLLECTIVE
===========================================================================
Scorecard AG root-caused the ``load_centroid_wfns`` hang that blocked every
multi-process GPU run on Frontera's ``rtx`` queue, from a live C-level stack:

    xla::gpu::AutotunerPass::RunImpl
      xla::Autotuner::Autotune(HloModule*, ..., MultiProcessKeyValueStore&)
        xla::DistributedKeyValueStore::Get
          xla::CoordinationServiceAgent::GetKeyValue    <-- blocks forever

``AutotunerPass`` shards autotuning across processes and exchanges the
results through the JAX coordination service.  **A process that skips
compilation never publishes its share, so every peer blocks forever.**
Therefore the hit/miss pattern of the persistent cache must be IDENTICAL
on every rank, for every module, or the job hangs.

The old layout made that impossible on purpose: entries were nested under
``{base}/np{P}/rank{i}/`` while JAX writes cache entries from process 0
only (``jax/_src/compiler.py::_cache_write``, unconditional::

      # Only write cache entries from the first process. Otherwise we
      # create problems with contention for writes on some filesystems
      if distributed.global_state.process_id != 0:
        return

), so ``np4/rank0`` accumulated 882 entries while ``np4/rank{1,2,3}``
stayed empty forever.  AG's fix was to REFUSE the cache at P > 1.  This
file replaces that refusal with a working implementation.

===========================================================================
THE DESIGN (workstream AH): SNAPSHOT AGREEMENT OVER A SHARED DIRECTORY
===========================================================================
1. **One shared directory per world size**, ``{base}/np{P}/``, plus a patch
   that makes the cache KEY process-invariant.

   AG.7 is right that a bare shared directory buys nothing: MEASURED at 4 CPU
   ranks, the ranks compute DIFFERENT keys for the same SPMD module, so
   process 0 — the only writer — is the only rank that ever hits, and its
   peers recompile everything.  jax/_src/cache_key.py strips the device
   assignment from the hashed compile options only for GPU

       strip_device_assignment=(backend.platform == "gpu")
       # In case of GPU multi-process tasks we need to strip device
       # assignment to use cache key as invariant between processes.

   and hashes the accelerator config as a serialized topology blob that also
   carries process-local content.  :func:`_install_invariant_key_patch` does
   for every platform what JAX already does for GPU (see its docstring).
   That is what turns the cache from *safe* into *effective*.

2. **Hit/miss agreement, taken once per run as a snapshot.**  Right here in
   :func:`ensure_jax_compile_cache`, after ``jax.distributed.initialize``:

   * process 0 lists the shared dir and publishes the sorted list of cache
     keys it can see, through the coordination-service KV store;
   * every rank fetches that list, checks which of those entries it can
     itself see, and publishes a presence BITMASK (one bit per key — 882
     entries is 111 bytes, so this scales to any world size);
   * process 0 ANDs the masks and publishes the result; every rank fetches
     it and a barrier commits the decision.

   The intersection is the set of entries the run is allowed to use.  Every
   subsequent cache probe is answered from that frozen set, so **hit/miss
   is identical on every rank by construction** — including for entries
   process 0 writes *during* this run, which are deliberately invisible
   until the next run.  That closes the within-run race that makes a naive
   shared directory unsafe: JAX's ``LRUCache.put`` is a plain
   ``cache_path.write_bytes(val)`` (NOT tmp+rename — verified in
   jax/_src/lru_cache.py 0.9.1), so a peer reading an entry the writer is
   still writing gets a truncated file, its read raises, ``_cache_read``
   swallows it into a MISS, and the ranks diverge.

3. **Writes stay process-0-only** (JAX's own rule).  Under SPMD process 0
   compiles the same module set as everyone else, so its writes cover the
   whole set; all-rank writes would only add Lustre contention.  We do
   however make the write ATOMIC (temp file + ``os.replace``) so a
   concurrently-running job can never observe a torn entry.

4. **JAX's auto-enabled XLA sub-caches are turned OFF at P > 1.**  When the
   persistent cache is on, ``jax/_src/compiler.py::get_compile_options``
   also points XLA at ``{cache_dir}/xla_gpu_per_fusion_autotune_cache_dir``
   with ``AutotuneCacheMode.UPDATE`` on process 0 and ``READ`` on the peers.
   That is a *second*, rank-asymmetric cache that changes the set of fusions
   each process still has to autotune — which is exactly the input to
   AutotunerPass' modulo-P work split.  Different sets on different ranks =
   the same deadlock one level down.  We set
   ``jax_persistent_cache_enable_xla_caches=""``.

5. **A key-environment fingerprint** rides along with each rank's bitmask
   (:func:`_key_env_fingerprint`).  The agreement decides which cache ENTRIES
   may be used; it cannot see that two ranks would compute different KEYS for
   the same module because they were launched with different ``XLA_FLAGS``.
   Any mismatch turns the cache off on every rank, loudly.

6. **Graceful degradation, never a hang.**  If the coordination client is
   missing, or any KV/barrier step fails or times out, or the key cannot be
   made process-invariant, the agreed set is EMPTY: every rank misses
   everything and compiles, which is the pre-AH behaviour and is always
   correct.  The reason is printed on every rank.  If an entry that *was*
   agreed then fails to load (corrupt file, deserialisation error) the ranks
   would diverge, so that path aborts the process loudly
   (``LORRAX_JAX_CACHE_STRICT=0`` downgrades it to a warning).

The load-bearing-ness of (2) was A/B'd on GPU with a node-local cache
directory, which JAX's process-0-only write leaves populated on one node and
empty on the others: without the agreement the warm run HANGS (rc=124 at
600 s); with it the same run completes in 48 s after dropping all 287
unshared entries.  With a genuinely shared directory and (1) in place there is
nothing left to diverge, so the agreement is insurance — but it is the
difference between a loud message and a dead job.

Considered and rejected: ``jax_share_binary_between_hosts`` — it is only
reached on a cache MISS (``compile_or_get_cached`` returns early on a hit),
so when process 0 hits and its peers miss, the peers wait forever on a
publication that never happens: the same deadlock.  Worse on CPU, where it
keys the broadcast on the per-rank cache key, so the peers would block on a
key process 0 never sets even on a symmetric cold miss.  (It also has exactly
one process compile, which reads as incompatible with a sharded autotuner —
but that is inference from the sources, not something measured here.)  It is
orthogonal to, not a substitute for, the agreement step.

    device assignment from the hashed compile options only when
