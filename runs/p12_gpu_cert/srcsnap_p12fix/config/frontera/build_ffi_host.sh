# build_ffi_host.sh — build liblorrax_ffi_host.so (the CUDA-free host-platform
# FFI library) on Frontera, WITH the phdf5 read AND write handlers.  RUN
# INSIDE the
# python:3.12 apptainer container (glibc 2.28+), same host Intel-MPI parallel
# HDF5 the CUDA build_ffi.sh uses for its phdf5 path — minus every
# CUDA/NCCL/cuSOLVERMp dependency.
#
#   config/frontera/build_ffi_host.sh [--fresh]
#
# Output: $LORRAX_FFI_HOST_STAGE/liblorrax_ffi_host.so
#   (default $LORRAX_FFI_STAGE_WTA/build_host; point LORRAX_FFI_HOST_SO there
#    at runtime).  A UNIQUE stage dir so it never clobbers the shared
#    $WORK/lorrax_ffi CUDA .so.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SLATE + ScaLAPACK (the distributed-linalg half of the lib) — OPT-IN
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# By default this script builds the phdf5-only lib (4 targets: 3 read + 1
# write), which needs no external numerical library.  Set
# LORRAX_SLATE_HOST_INSTALL_DIR to a gpu_backend=none SLATE install and you
# get all 11 host targets (phdf5×4, slate×5, scalapack×2):
#
#   LORRAX_SLATE_HOST_INSTALL_DIR=$WORK/slate_builds/cpu/install \
#     config/frontera/build_ffi_host.sh --fresh
#
# Building that SLATE install is a SEPARATE, one-time step; SLATE is external
# source, so its two Frontera deviations cannot live in this repo's CMake and
# are recorded here instead (workstream L, 2026-07-25; the working script is
# /scratch2/08271/jackmc/lorrax_setup/wk_L/build_slate_host.sh):
#
#   1. PATCH SLATE: "LANGUAGES CXX Fortran" -> "LANGUAGES CXX".
#      SLATE declares Fortran but uses it NOWHERE (only in the commented-out
#      scalapack_api); the py312 container has no gfortran, so the configure
#      dies before compiling anything.  One line, applied to the SLATE source
#      tree before configuring:
#
#        sed -i 's/    LANGUAGES CXX Fortran/    LANGUAGES CXX/' \
#            "$SLATE_SRC/CMakeLists.txt"
#
#   2. CONFIGURE SLATE with MKL, not libsci (the Perlmutter recipe's default):
#        -Dgpu_backend=none -Dblas=mkl -Dblas_int=int -Dblas_threaded=true
#        -Dbuild_tests=no -DSCALAPACK_LIBRARIES=""
#        -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib64
#      (SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES="" is why THIS lib must link ScaLAPACK itself —
#       see the ScaLAPACK block in src/ffi/cpp/CMakeLists.txt.)
#
#   3. BUILD ON NODE-LOCAL /tmp.  /work2 is Lustre; under a concurrent
#      40-node job even `python -c pass` from the venv stalls minutes in
#      ptlrpc_set_wait.  Stage the SLATE source + cmake/ninja ELF binaries to
#      /tmp (one sequential tar read, ~2-min build) and pass
#      -DLORRAX_XLA_FFI_INCLUDE_DIR explicitly so cmake never imports jax.
#
# Runtime for the SLATE/ScaLAPACK targets needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH ⊇ MKL libdir
# + the Intel compiler runtime (libimf/libsvml/libirng/libintlc) + SLATE's
# lib64.  KNOWN BUG L-2: SLATE host `heev` SIGSEGVs deterministically (even
# 1×1, n=64) and is REJECTED at resolve time on CPU meshes.  The distributed
# CPU eigh is ScaLAPACK `pzheevd` (ScalapackEighHostFfi, workstream V);
# potrf/trsm/ScaLAPACK getrf are clean.  See docs/dev/linalg_ffi.md.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHICH LIBRARY SUPPLIES WHAT, AND HOW ITS ABSENCE ANNOUNCES ITSELF
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Four numerical libraries can end up inside liblorrax_ffi_host.so.  THREE OF
# THE FOUR ARE INTERCHANGEABLE WITH ANOTHER VENDOR'S, because LORRAX calls a
# published API, not a product:
#
#   what is linked here           API LORRAX calls        swap it for

#   libmkl_scalapack_lp64 +       ScaLAPACK + C-BLACS     Cray LibSci
#   libmkl_blacs_intelmpi_lp64    (11 Fortran-ABI names,  (libsci_*_mpi_*),
#   (+ the mkl_intel/thread/core  hand-declared in        netlib, AOCL, or
#   layers they need)             cpp/scalapack/          SLATE's own

#   libmkl_intel_lp64 (DFTI)      DftiCreateDescriptor/   NOTHING — DFTI is
#                                 SetValue/Compute*       Intel-only.  This is
#                                                         the one host family
#                                                         with a single-vendor
#                                                         API.
#   libslate + blaspp/lapackpp    slate:: C++ templates   NOTHING — a template
#                                                         library has no ABI a
#                                                         second vendor could
#                                                         implement.
#
# To use a different ScaLAPACK, pass the whole link line and skip the MKL
# probe entirely — no source change, nothing else to configure:
#
#   LORRAX_SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES="-L/opt/cray/pe/libsci/.../lib -lsci_gnu_mpi_mp -lsci_gnu_mp" \
#     config/frontera/build_ffi_host.sh --fresh
#
# The three groups are independent: no SLATE install still gives you the
# ScaLAPACK, GEMM and FFT handlers, and no ScaLAPACK still gives you SLATE's.
# Each group prints one configure line saying what it resolved or why it was
# skipped — READ THE CONFIGURE LOG FIRST.  If you no longer have it, the
# runtime symptoms map back like this:
#
#   cannot resolve pzheevd_/pdsyevd_/pzgetrf_/pdgetrf_/pzgetrs_/pdgetrs_/
#   numroc_/descinit_/Csys2blacs_handle/Cblacs_gridinit/Cblacs_gridinfo
#       -> no ScaLAPACK+BLACS was linked.  Set LORRAX_MKL_ROOT, or pass
#       LORRAX_SCALAPACK_LIBRARIES.  Those ELEVEN names are the ENTIRE
#       ScaLAPACK surface LORRAX uses — measured as the complete
#       undefined-symbol set of the two handler objects outside libc.
#   cannot resolve cblas_dgemm/cblas_zgemm  -> a CBLAS header was found but
#       its library was not on the link line.  (cblas_?gemm_batch will never
#       appear here; it is looked up at runtime and its absence just selects
#       the plain-GEMM loop.)
#   cannot resolve Dfti*  -> the MKL runtime is missing from LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
#   cannot resolve a mangled _ZN5slate...  -> libslate.so is missing from
#       LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
#   a collective hangs or aborts inside blacs_gridinit, no message  -> the
#       BLACS flavour does not match the MPI.  MKL ships one BLACS per MPI
#       (mkl_blacs_intelmpi_lp64 vs mkl_blacs_openmpi_lp64); the wrong one
#       links perfectly and only fails at the first grid call.
#
# The authoritative version of this map, with the CMake variable names, is the
# "HOST NUMERICAL LIBRARIES" block at the top of the resolution section in
# src/ffi/cpp/CMakeLists.txt.
